<h2>How to join a game in FoundryVTT</h2>
<p>You can join Foundry games by going to the link that the host has given you. Links may come in the form of <u>http://ip:port</u> formats (e.g. <u>http://192.168.0.1:3000)</u> which is common in self-hosting setups where the host runs the game through their computer, or it may also come in the form of custom domains (like our very own <a href="https://dnd.leveloneadventure.me/">https://dnd.leveloneadventure.me</a>) which may or may not support SSL. The latter is usually hosted on a dedicated cloud servers, or in some cases, self-hosted dedicated servers.</p>
<h3>Login</h3>
<p>The FoundryVTT login screen looks something like this:</p>

<p>Your username and access key is usually setup for you, and you may request to change them as you wish. If you were not provided one, contact your DM immediately to have that sorted out. Game schedules and the introduction to the adventure can also be found in the login screen.</p>
<h2><strong>The Basics</strong></h2>
<p>The best way to learn how to play in Foundry is to play a game in it! With enough patience, you could learn the basics of rolling dice, updating your character sheet, moving tokens, and communicating with other players right before a session starts.</p>
<p>However, if you want to know absolutely everything about the player controls, Encounter Library has you covered. Here's his video on player controls! <i>Note that modules will modify some aspects of play in Foundry, but the basics will make it easier to navigate through the menus and adapt to modules so give it a watch if you have the time. </i>ðŸ˜Š</p>

<h2>Character Creation</h2>
<p>Character creation in FoundryVTT can be done in a number of ways: manually, via D&amp;D Beyond Import, or by using a <a href="/foundrytuts/charactercreation">module</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Manual character creation</strong> is the closest you can get to emulating the pen-and-paper feel of in-person games. While this is still widely practiced, it requires a thorough understanding of the rules of character creation, levelling, and maintenance. <u>This method is compatible with most modules, but it is still possible for it not to play well with automation.</u></li>
  <li><strong>D&amp;D Beyond import</strong> is by far the simplest method to do. Just send your D&amp;D Beyond link to the DM, and your character, including spells, will be imported in seconds. Updating your D&amp;D Beyond through Foundry is possible, but it is a 3rd party solution that requires supporting the 3rd party's <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MrPrimate">Patreon</a>.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="/foundrytuts/charactercreation">Character creation via module</strong></a> is done primarily through <i>Plutonium</i>, a product of 5eTools. It is the closest thing to an automatic character creation tool for now. You can learn more about it <a href="/foundrytuts/charactercreation">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
