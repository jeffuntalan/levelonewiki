<h2>In-Game Reminders</h2>
<p>Here are a few reminders to maintain peace and hopefully, make the game feel safer and fun ðŸ˜Š.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The reminders below are just callouts for some behaviors which can affect player interaction, but all of them are secondary to just being <strong>compassionate</strong> towards others.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <li><strong>No aggression towards any person playing</strong>. Any form of aggressive behavior can make others feel uncomfortable and it will affect our interactions with each other. If something didn't go as you'd hoped, the first thing to do should be to voice it out calmly (or send the DM a message or whisper). <i>Oks lang maging aggressive towards monsters, NPCs, or the BBEG, but let's always be nice to our co-players.</i></li>
  <li><strong>No homophobia, sexism, racism, or any other semblance of bigotry.</strong> Same as Red's game rules. This rule should apply here since we're decent people who live in the 21st century.</li>
  <li><strong>Don't patronize anyone.</strong> Superiority complexes have no place in a game where we play as equals. We're all friends and party members here.</li>
  <li><strong>Don't make fun of other people.</strong> It's alright to tell jokes in game since it defuses some of the stress of the situation we're in and it breaks the monotony of serious stuff, just don't aim it at other people. We can't know for sure who can or can't take targeted humor, so let's just avoid it entirely since asking around who's alright with it can be awkward in itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Value other people's time</strong>. D&amp;D can be a long game to play so the timeslot of it is crucial to maximize play time while balancing real life. Some people have only a limited number of hours to play per week so let's not cut it short by being late, or by interrupting sessions to promote unrelated stuff. Cancellations are alright since there are things in life that we can't control or that we need to shift our utmost attention to (like acads), but let's keep in mind that other people have alloted their time per week for this game so only cancel if it can't be helped.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, While at this table, I may not entertain some player interactions that would place other players at a disadvantage (such as stealing from other PCs, killing, or disabling them, etc.). While we certainly put our hearts into this amazing game, we shouldn't play it at the expense of other people.&nbsp;</p>
