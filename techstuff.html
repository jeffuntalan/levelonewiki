<h2><strong>Servers</strong></h2>
<p>A server is essentially a computer that serves information remotely to end-users like you (clients). In my setup, I use Virtual Machines (VMs) on remote servers to host FoundryVTT games and this wiki.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Where do I get one?</h2>
<p>The simplest way to have your own server is to allocate a device for use as one. A good candidate for this is an old laptop installed with a server OS like Ubuntu 20.04, or a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian. There are also lots of hosting providers out there that can provide you a good starting point to host your own stuff. Here I'll focus on the ones I've used: <strong>Oracle Cloud</strong>, <strong>Digital Ocean</strong>, and <strong>Azure:</strong></p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/">Oracle Cloud</a></h3>
          <p>Despite its unpopularity due to its lawsuit against Google and a bunch of other stuff, Oracle Cloud has one of the best “free tiers” on this list. When you sign up for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, you'll get <strong>two Virtual Machines with 1GB RAM each</strong> (one of these is enough to run an instance of Foundry or any lightweight program). They've recently added the ability to create up to 4 ARM-based VMs on the free tier with a combined total of 24GB of RAM. <strong>Available storage</strong> for these instances have a combined total of <strong>200 GB</strong>, the <i>biggest</i> of any free tier cloud providers, and they allow an <strong>outbound bandwidth of 10TB per month</strong>. More than enough even if you do daily D&amp;D sessions. It's also <u>free for life</u> (or at least until they change their minds). <strong>You will need a credit card to </strong><a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/"><strong>signup</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a></h3>
          <p>They don't provide anything for&nbsp;free, but they have the best reputation of the cloud providers I've tried. It is also highly recommended by the Foundry Community. You'll get <strong>1GB of RAM</strong> on the instance, and about <strong>25GB of storage</strong>. <strong>Outbound bandwidth is at 1TB per month</strong>. For each VM instance (or “droplet”) you create, that would cost around <mark class="pen-red">$5 per month</mark>. <strong>You will need a credit card to </strong><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"><strong>signup</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Digital Ocean partnered with <a href="https://education.github.com/">Github Education</a>, giving students $100 in credit. With that amount you can host a VM instance for a year without any cost. However, you'll still need to have a credit card during signup even if you do so with Github. Don't forget to register for <a href="https://education.github.com/">Github Education</a> using your school email to avail of a LOT of benefits (including domains) if you're a student.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/">Azure</a></h3>
          <p>Microsoft runs this. You essentially get 1 Linux based VM and 1 Windows VM for their free tier (which lasts for only 1 year). It's <strong>1GB of RAM</strong>, has a maximum of <strong>64GB of storage</strong>, and a measly outbound bandwidth of <strong>15GB per month</strong>. You can avail of these for 1 year, as long as you <strong>signup with a credit card or debit card.</strong></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Azure is also partnered with <a href="https://education.github.com/">Github Education</a>, giving you the ability to avail of their <strong>free-tier services for 1 year</strong>, along with <strong>$100 in credit</strong>. <strong>No credit card needed if you signup with your school email through </strong><a href="https://education.github.com/"><strong>Github Education</strong></a>.</p>

<h3>So which one?</h3>
<p>I'm on Oracle because it's free, giving me the freedom of not charging my players anything besides a few hours of their lives to play D&amp;D. However, I keep mirror backups of my active Foundry installations and data folder both on my personal computer, and on a separate Digital Ocean instance. I also use Azure, but not for Foundry. I use Azure just as a dedicated server for Don't Starve Together.</p>
<h2>Operating System</h2>
<p>The OS I use on my VMs is <strong>Ubuntu 20.04</strong>. As such, the tutorials here will be done with Ubuntu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any Linux OS will be offered for free on any of the hosting providers mentioned above. I don't use Windows server because it can incur licensing fees which may charge your card if you're not careful.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Installing FoundryVTT on a VM</h2>
<p>After you've chosen which hosting providers works best for you, you can go ahead and checkout these tutorials!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You will need a basic understanding of changing directories depending on the user account you're using if you opted to use Digital Ocean or Azure to proceed.</p>

          <p><strong>For Azure:</strong> While the FoundryVTT wiki covers Azure on <a href="https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/setup/hosting/self-hosting-on-azure">one of their tutorials</a>, I found it simpler to use the same approach with Digital Ocean and just start at<strong> </strong><a href="https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/setup/hosting/always-free-oracle#D5"><strong>step D5</strong></a><strong> </strong>of the Oracle Tutorial. You should also remember to<strong> rename the user</strong> <code>ubuntu</code> user in commands to <code>root</code> (or any use you've added) to avoid getting errors, and to <a href="https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/setup/hosting/always-free-oracle#D7"><strong>skip step D7</strong></a> of the tutorial since a different approach is needed to open up the necessary ports for Azure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Renaming the user directories during install</h3>
<p>Whenever a command for foundry references the user directory (the directory after <code>/home/</code> in the example below, the user is <code>ubuntu</code>) you should make the appropriate changes to the syntax.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">node /home/ubuntu/foundry/resources/app/main.js --dataPath=/home/ubuntu/foundryuserdata</code></pre>
<p>The above example is the command used to run the FoundryVTT server using node in the Oracle tutorial. The example is useful for installations where the default user is name <code>ubuntu</code> like in Oracle Cloud. However, what if I use Digital ocean or Azure? Well, you'll need to know the user account you're using (the <strong>default for Digital Ocean is </strong><code><strong>root</strong></code> while the <strong>default for Azure is </strong><code><strong>azureuser</strong></code>) and make the necessary modifications.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Let's say I use Azure:</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">node /home/azureuser/foundry/resources/app/main.js --dataPath=/home/azureuser/foundryuserdata</code></pre>
<p>That would properly run the foundry instance if you've followed along the Oracle tutorial on Azure.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>I tried this on Digital Ocean but it didn't work. What's up?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the syntax for VMs configured with root accounts.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">node /root/foundry/resources/app/main.js --dataPath=/root/foundryuserdata</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice that the <code>/home/</code> directory is not included. This is because the root account is the foundation of user access in linux. In normal use cases, it is not recommended to use root user accounts as primaries since they introduce a slew of access privileges and alongside it, vulnerabilities. For the purpose of simplicity and in <i>assumption that you're not going to use Foundry in the largescale, but only with friends</i>, this should be good.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Remember that this is not the only event that you'll encounter this. <strong>Always scan your syntax</strong> for any misconfigured directories. It is very easy to just copy and paste the necessary commands in Ubuntu, but it is still not fool-proof, especially if you're adapting proven methods onto other environment like we do here.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Bonus: Configuring Caddy with multiple programs</h2>
<p>The caddyfile for my own foundry install goes something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># This replaces the existing content in /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

# A CONFIG SECTION FOR YOUR HOSTNAME
dnd.leveloneadventure.me {
    # PROXY ALL REQUEST TO PORT 30000
    reverse_proxy localhost:30000
}

# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
# https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice that my domain <code>dnd.leveloneadventure.me</code>is in the proper section and that the port is set to the Foundry default of <code>30000</code>. But what if I want to reverse proxy another program using Caddy <strong>on the same VM?</strong> Good news! The config is easy enough.</p>
<p>Let's say we have a program that uses the port <code>3000</code>(as in the case of Wiki.js) we simply need to alter the domain we will use to access the program and add the appropriate port to use. We can do this on another line of config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># This replaces the existing content in /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

# A CONFIG SECTION FOR YOUR HOSTNAME
dnd.leveloneadventure.me {
    # PROXY ALL REQUEST TO PORT 30000
    reverse_proxy localhost:30000
}
# A CONFIG SECTION FOR YOUR HOSTNAME
notes.leveloneadventure.me {
    # PROXY ALL REQUEST TO PORT 3000
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}

# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
# https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile</code></pre>
<p>Now we have the ports <code>30000</code> and <code>3000</code>being reverse-proxied to <code>dnd.leveloneadventure.me</code> and <code>notes.leveloneadventure.me</code> respectively!</p>
<p>Remember to restart Caddy to apply the changes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo service caddy restart</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You will need to add an “A RECORD" on you domain provider's DNS settings that points to your VM's public IP address for this to work. Make sure you set the subdomains to match the ones you've configured on your caddyfile.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
<p>You've made it this far. This experience will definitely level up your comfort with using the terminal and the Ubuntu server OS. You can branch out and apply this knowledge to other projects like <strong>setting up dedicated servers</strong> for games, or hosting your own wiki like this one! The procedures will be <i><strong>vastly</strong></i> different, but I know you'll be able to do it! 😊</p>
