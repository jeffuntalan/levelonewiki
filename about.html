<h2><strong>About the wiki</strong></h2>
<p>This wiki runs on <a href="https://js.wiki/">Wiki.js</a> and is hosted in a VM on an Oracle Cloud server in Seoul. This wiki was created to provide a single location to store a variety of documentation covering D&amp;D session notes, tutorials on using Foundry, setting up your own instances, other stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why Wiki.js?</h3>
<p>I chose Wiki.js as the foundation for this wiki since it shares the same runtime as <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/">Foundry</a>, which is <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>. Allowing me to apply similar approaches to hosting.</p>
<h3>Can I contribute?</h3>
<p>Yes! Currently, I'm the only contributor to this platform which I also manage. You can contribute by requesting an account here, or by sending me your notes! You can also suggest content you would like to have here such as tutorials.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>FoundryVTT</h2>
<p>The developer-friendly virtual tabletop solution for tabletop-RPGs. <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/">Foundry</a> remains to be the best software of it's kind that I've used. Here are the pros and cons of using Foundry during my time using and configuring it.</p>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Price</strong></td>
        <td>Foundry is cheap, if you look at it in a long-term perspective since it is has a <strong>buy-once-use-forever</strong> model. Only one license is bought (usually by the dungeon master) while the players connect for free through their browsers.</td>
        <td>Other VTTs have free-tier account like Roll20 and Astral, while others like Owlbear Rodeo are entirely free with no payments needed. <strong>The Initial price of Foundry is very steep at $50</strong>, which may not be ideal for some groups.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Setup</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Players have it easy.</strong></td>
        <td>
          <p><strong>Setting up Foundry can be a pain if you are unfamiliar with network configuration or a Linux command line</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Running a game via your laptop would require you to setup port forwarding on your router, or use 3rd party services.</li>
            <li>Hosting the game via cloud servers can be a complicated process.</li>
          </ul>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Configuration</strong></td>
        <td><strong>You get all the customization options you want</strong> when it comes to game systems and rulesets. The community is continuously adding and improving game systems and modules, making the platform a very diverse place. If you desire a certain functionality, there's probably a module for it.</td>
        <td>Since community developers (and not the devs) make the game systems and modules, some may be outdated or abandoned entirely. Non-popular game systems like Honey-Heist can have incompatibilities since the developer has not updated them yet.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Aesthetics</strong></td>
        <td><strong>It's pretty</strong>. Dynamic lighting is native, roof tiles are supported, spell icons are baked in, journals can be shown to players at will and can be edited via markdown. The UI also looks great and organized.</td>
        <td>--</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Storage</strong></td>
        <td>&nbsp;<strong>No storage limits. No file type limitations. </strong>As long as your computer/server has enough storage, you can add whatever file with whatever size you fancy.</td>
        <td>--</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Functionality</strong></td>
        <td>Once you get it setup and configured, it's very easy to use and has a lot of features that you'd have to pay a ton of money on if you were on other VTTs.</td>
        <td>--</td>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm a huge D&amp;D nerd. I like tinkering with tech, playing guitar, cycling, reading, and writing literary works. I listen to country music a lot, Matt Colville is my hero, and I love my friends so much that I want everything setup for them (like this platform!). Nice meeting you!</p>
