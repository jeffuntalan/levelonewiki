<h2>Installing FoundryVTT on a VM</h2>
<p>After you've chosen which hosting providers works best for you, you can go ahead and checkout these tutorials!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You will need a basic understanding of changing directories depending on the user account you're using if you opted to use Digital Ocean or Azure to proceed.</p>

          <p><strong>For Azure:</strong> While the FoundryVTT wiki covers Azure on <a href="https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/setup/hosting/self-hosting-on-azure">one of their tutorials</a>, I found it simpler to use the same approach with Digital Ocean and just start at &nbsp;<a href="https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/setup/hosting/always-free-oracle#D5"><strong>step D5</strong></a>of the Oracle Tutorial. You should also remember to<strong> rename the user</strong> <code>ubuntu</code> user in commands to <code>azureuser</code> (or any use you've added) to avoid getting errors, and to <a href="https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/setup/hosting/always-free-oracle#D7"><strong>skip step D7</strong></a> of the tutorial since a different approach is needed to open up the necessary ports for Azure.&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>At any point during the setup, you can go to the <strong>Networking</strong> tab of your Virtual Machine in Azure, and add an inbound port rule allowing access to <strong>port 30000</strong>.</li>

<h3>Renaming the user directories during install</h3>
<p>Whenever a command for foundry references the user directory (the directory after <code>/home/</code> in the example below, the user is <code>ubuntu</code>) you should make the appropriate changes to the syntax.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">node /home/ubuntu/foundry/resources/app/main.js --dataPath=/home/ubuntu/foundryuserdata</code></pre>
<p>The above example is the command used to run the FoundryVTT server using node in the Oracle tutorial. The example is useful for installations where the default user is name <code>ubuntu</code> like in Oracle Cloud. However, what if I use Digital ocean or Azure? Well, you'll need to know the user account you're using (the <strong>default for Digital Ocean is </strong><code><strong>root</strong></code> while the <strong>default for Azure is </strong><code><strong>azureuser</strong></code>) and make the necessary modifications.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Let's say I use Azure:</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">node /home/azureuser/foundry/resources/app/main.js --dataPath=/home/azureuser/foundryuserdata</code></pre>
<p>That would properly run the foundry instance if you've followed along the Oracle tutorial on Azure.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>I tried this on Digital Ocean but it didn't work. What's up?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the syntax for VMs configured with root accounts.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">node /root/foundry/resources/app/main.js --dataPath=/root/foundryuserdata</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice that the <code>/home/</code> directory is not included. This is because the root account is the foundation of user access in linux. In normal use cases, it is not recommended to use root user accounts as primaries since they introduce a slew of access privileges and alongside it, vulnerabilities. For the purpose of simplicity and in <i>assumption that you're not going to use Foundry in the largescale, but only with friends</i>, this should be good.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Remember that this is not the only event that you'll encounter this. <strong>Always scan your syntax</strong> for any misconfigured directories. It is very easy to just copy and paste the necessary commands in Ubuntu, but it is still not fool-proof, especially if you're adapting proven methods onto other environment like we do here.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
<p>You've made it this far. This experience will definitely level up your comfort with using the terminal and the Ubuntu server OS. You can branch out and apply this knowledge to other projects like <strong>setting up dedicated servers</strong> for games, or hosting your own wiki like this one! The procedures will be <i><strong>vastly</strong></i> different, but I know you'll be able to do it! ðŸ˜Š</p>
