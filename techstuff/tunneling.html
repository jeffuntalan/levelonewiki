<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong><u>A Remote Server</u>&nbsp;</strong><br><i>The remote server must have a non-restricted internet connection with no CGNAT. It must also have a Public IP ADRESS (ipv4). You can use VMs from Digital Ocean, Oracle Cloud, Azure, or any cloud provider you prefer.&nbsp;</i></li>
  <li><strong><u>A Domain Name with an A RECORD pointed to the server's IP</u></strong><br><i>A custom domain name is required for this tutorial. The domain/subdomain that we'll be using will be used by the proxy server to point to your local machine.</i></li>
</ol>
<h2>Setting Up the Server</h2>
<p>Setting up the server is divided into two parts: installing the binaries for the required packages, and configuring the packages.</p>
<h3>Installing the binaries</h3>
<p><br>First we must update the server:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y</code></pre>
<p>That takes care of that. Once the server finishes updating, let's install the Inlets packages onto the server:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">curl -sLS https://get.inlets.dev | sudo sh</code></pre>
<p>Once inlets is installed, we need one more thing. Caddy is a open source web server that automagically handles SSL for us, thus our website will be served over HTTPS without any additional hassle of paying or setting up certificates. Let's install Caddy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo apt-key add -
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install caddy</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Configuring Inlets and Caddy</h3>
<p>Now that've got everything installed, let's create a service for the Inlets server so restarts are automated even if the server reboots. Let's create the systemctl file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/YOURPREFERREDNAME.service</code></pre>
<p>note that <code>YOURPREFERREDNAME</code> can be changed to any name you want for the inlets service.</p>
<p>Once the file has been created and you're in the nano text editor, paste the following configs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">[Unit]
Description=Inlets Exit Server
After=network.target network-online.target
Requires=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
StartLimitInterval=0
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/inlets server --port=8080 --token=1111

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>
<p>Change <code>--port=8080</code> to your preferred port number and <code>--token=1111</code> to your preferred token number. The token will be needed by the client to connect securely. Press <code>CTRL+X</code> then <code>Y</code> then <code>ENTER</code> to save changes.</p>
<p>Now that the service has been added to systemctl, we need to reload systemctl to reflect the changes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo systemctl daemon-reload</code></pre>
<p>Now let's enable the service at boot and start it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo systemctl enable YOURPREFERREDNAME
sudo service YOURPREFERREDNAME start</code></pre>
<p>For good measure, check if the service is running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo service YOURPREFERREDNAME status</code></pre>
<p><strong>Make sure it outputs that the service is active, and that it is listening to the port you've selected.</strong></p>
<p>Now that Inlets has been configure for the server, let's configure Caddy. The easiest way to setup caddy is via the Caddyfile, so let's edit that.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile</code></pre>
<p>Inside the Caddyfile, delete everything and replace it with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># This replaces the existing content in /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

# A CONFIG SECTION FOR YOUR main
your.domain.com {
    # PROXY ALL REQUEST TO PORT 8080
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
# https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that you change <code>your.domain.com</code> with you actual domain/subdomain. Also make sure that it points to the IP of the remote server. Remember to check the port in <code>localhost:8080</code> to see if it matches the ported youve assigned previously. Press <code>CTRL+X</code> then <code>Y</code> then <code>ENTER</code> to save changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the Caddyfile has been saved, restart Caddy.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo service caddy restart</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it for the server! Next we move on the setting up the clients.</p>
<h2>Setting Up Clients</h2>
<p>First we must make sure that the program or app we want to expose is active and is currently set to an open port. Let's use Foundry as an example. Start foundry and it should be using port 30000 for its connections. Let's use this as an example going forwards.</p>
<p>First we must install Inlets for the local machine (client):</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">curl -sLS https://get.inlets.dev | sudo sh</code></pre>
<p>Now that Inlets is installed, let's create a service that starts inlets automagically:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/YOURPREFERREDSERVICE.service</code></pre>
<p>Remember to change <code>YOURPREFERREDSERVICE</code> with a service name you want. This name will be used to start, stop, or restart the service.</p>
<p>In the nano text editor, enter the following but modify the appropriate fields:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">[Unit]
Description=Inlets Exit Server
After=network.target network-online.target
Requires=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
StartLimitInterval=0
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/inlets client --url wss://your.domain.com --upstream http://127.0.0.1:PORT --token=1111

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>
<p>Okay. Now we need to take note of a few things before we save. <code>your.domain.com</code> must be replaced by the domain you've configured for the server. <code>PORT</code> must be replaced by the appropriate port your app/program is using. For Foundry, this is 30000. Finally, <code>1111</code> must be replaced by the token you've entered in the server. THEY MUST MATCH.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press <code>CTRL+X</code> then <code>Y</code> then <code>ENTER</code> to save changes.</p>
<p>Okay now we need to once again reload the daemon:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo systemctl daemon-reload</code></pre>
<p>And now enable the service at boot and start it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo systemctl enable YOURPREFERREDSERVICE
sudo service YOURPREFERREDSERVICE start</code></pre>
<p>For good measure let's check if it's running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">sudo service YOURPREFERREDSERVICE status</code></pre>
<p><strong>It should output that the service is active, and that it is “connecting to proxy”.</strong></p>
<p>Now for the moment of truth, open up a browser and key in <code>your.domain.com</code> and check if your previously CGNAT-restricted app/program is being served publicly via your domain.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Final Notes</h2>
<p>With proper configuration, Inlets and Caddy can serve and web app, Node.js application, or even games! Other services may offer an easier way of circumventing CGNAT, such as ngrok, but those services have no option of setting a custom domain along with your public link. If you have any other questions or if you spot a mistake in the commands, don't hesitate to message me! I'll update the docs accordingly :)</p>
