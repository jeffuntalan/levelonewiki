<p><a href="/D&amp;D/COS"><strong>â‡¤Curse of Strahd</strong></a></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><i><strong>Day 7</strong></i></p>
<ol>
  <li>Morgantha breaks into Winery while PCs are sleeping, killing Snakhen in the process, and rousing the remaining PCs and Ireena into killing Morgantha. Bangdrum finds a black stone with orange glowing accents among Morgantha's remains.</li>
  <li>PCs and Adrian Martikov bury Snakhen.</li>
  <li>The other wereravens arrive and bring PCs the news about their scouting mission on Yester Hill, and their accident. Stephania Martikov and her son Claudiu were captured by Berserkers and Druids in Yester Hill. An effigy of Strahd lies within the druid circle atop Yester Hill.</li>
  <li>PCs take up on the Martikov's plea for help, and assemble immediately for Yester Hill.</li>
  <li>PCs assemble marching order with the wereravens as the vanguard.</li>
  <li>Along the road to Yester Hill, they encounter a trapped bear. The Martikovs alert the players of the trap and the figure that crouches amongst the bushes.</li>
  <li>Ram Ram sneaks in and surprises the character, the Martikovs soon follow.</li>
  <li>A Tiefling (identity still unknown to players, no introductions were made) by the name of Camus was about to kill the trapped bear for food while on his way to Yester Hill, where a voice was leading him towards a promise of power in exchange for delivering punishment to his "children".</li>
  <li>Camus tails the party on his summoned steed, PCs and Martikovs proceed to Yester Hill on foot and in stealth.</li>
  <li>Davian Martikov stops the party (except Camus) to discuss the layout of the Hill, Dag Tomescu (Stephania's wife) grows impatient of the plan and tranforms into a wereraven, seeking his wife and child.</li>
  <li>Ram Ram casts <i>pass without trace</i> on party and Martikovs. They sneak up the hill and pass two concentric rings of cairns. Meanwhile, Camus claims the <a href="https://noads.5e.tools/items.html#blood%20spear_cos">Blood Spear</a> from Kavan's grave. Kavan urges Camus to bathe the spear with the blood of the druids and berserkers.</li>
  <li>Camus dives right into the druid's circle after obtaining the spear, immediately getting surrounded by 3 Berserkers. Bangdrum and Ram Ram help Camus, while the Martikovs prioritize getting Stephania free from her binds beneath the effigy of Strahd atop Yester Hill.</li>
  <li>Elvir manages to retrieve one of three stolen Gems of Wine embedded in the effigy.</li>
  <li>PCs kill the Berserkers and proceed to the Gulthias Tree, which is surrounded by 6 druid performing a ritual. Claudiu Martikov is in the gaping mouth of the Gulthias Tree, bleeding.</li>
  <li>PCs interrupt the ritual, defeat the druids, and reclaim Claudiu.</li>
  <li>Camus finds <a href="https://noads.5e.tools/items.html#treebane_cos"><code>Treebane</code></a>, an old adventurer's axe used in a failed attempt to cut the Gulthias Tree. Ireena obtains the <a href="https://noads.5e.tools/items.html#sunsword_cos"><code>Sunsword</code></a>, passes it to the party, and causes a squabble between Ram Ram and Camus. Ram Ram declines to hand over the <a href="https://noads.5e.tools/items.html#sunsword_cos"><code>Sunsword</code></a> but throws it to Bangdrum, which immediately attunes to him being a cleric of good alignment.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Bangdrum activates the <a href="https://noads.5e.tools/items.html#sunsword_cos">Sunsword</a>, illuminating the surrounding land, and revealing a lurking figure at the edge of the forest down Yester Hill. Elvir rushes in to investigate the figure, but finds no one.</li>
  <li>The PCs are left by Davian, Stephania, Claudiu and Dag, who insists they return home immediately. Elvir and Adrian accompany them home. Camus offers a Ireena a ride, and the party treks back to the winery.</li>
  <li>Strahd von Zarovich confront the players on the road, claiming that the sword the players have is an old family relic and insists on having it back. He claims that it is a crystal sword with a platinum hilt bearing the von Zarovich crest.</li>
  <li>A fight ensues for the sword, Bangdrum beats the odds, successfully resists Strahd's charm, and equips the sword. To Strahd's surprise, the previously crystal blade is now pure sunlight, which turns the fight around and places him in a disadvantage. He retreats and commands Anastrasya Karelova, his informant, to retrieve the sword herself, as she failed to identify the sunlight property of the glimmering sword.</li>
  <li>PCs manage to win against Anastrasya, leaving her in a helpless, mist form.</li>
  <li>PCs retreat back to the Wizard of Wines.</li>
