<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p><i>Day 5</i></p>
<ol>
  <li>Wizard Mighty Tea was awakened from her sleep by Ireena who is concerned about a dream.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"Sorry if I only wanted to talk to you. You're the only other woman in the group, and you don't speak ill of me. I don't know who else to tell. I had a dream last night. I was wearing a flowing pale blue gown in Krezk. Within its walls stands a gazebo close to a pond of crystal blue water. A man wearing silver armor stands in the Gondola. I was standing by the water when he called out to me. "Tatyana", he called me. I answered and walked towards him. He hugged me in the gazebo. On his belt hung a silver hilt with no blade. That's all I remember. Please don't tell anyone."</i></span><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>She immediately tells Tywin, who in turn, tells the rest of the Party. Rictavio knocks, but is told to come back at 10AM while the party cures themselves of their cackle fever. The effects of Pale Tincture remain.</li>
  <li>Rictavio wishes to talk to the party regarding the Tarokka, the PCs' suspicious encounters with Strahd, and wereravens. Rictavio proceeds to tell the PCs the missing locations on their Tarokka Reading. Rictavio has not told the PCs about their fated ally against Strahd.</li>
  <li>After Rictavio records the properties of Strahd's Tarokka, he goes to his room and the PCs proceed to the main floor of Blue Water Inn. Vasili was seen by Danika Martikov and was urged to go inside to eat lunch after a heavy night of drinking. He introduces himself to Ireena, and hands the players his own map of the lands.</li>
  <li>A guard warns PCs about the "rat" of the city, Vasili, and tells them that they are better off not associating themselves with him. They hand PCs the <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9ac4b57b-2226-4623-b09e-27821a509ec2/Laws_of_Vallaki.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20210528%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20210528T114831Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=86400&amp;X-Amz-Signature=1985b5a836908f864e55a39d2d3ef1d1964a1c15082e0fe755f9288fe6eb3b99&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Laws%2520of%2520Vallaki.pdf%22">list of laws in Vallaki</a>.</li>
  <li>PCs walk along Vallaki, where they notice that children stare in awe at Ireena, and talks in hushed voices as you go.</li>
  <li>PCs proceed to church to obtain Holy Water, free of charge from the church. They meet Father Lucien, who described the church of St. Andral as consecrated.</li>
  <li>PCs proceed to Arasek Stockyard, asks for some items, buys some. Hears some roars from carnival wagon. PCs encounter Urwin Martikov, who requests that they help him investigate the late wine deliveries. PCs take him up on this quest. He promises to provide them 300 gold pieces to find out the problem, and if the players solve it, he then promised to provide the party free food and lodging at the Blue Water Inn.</li>
  <li>PCs proceed to Burgomaster's Mansion, who reads Ismark's letter about Ireena's situation. Burgomaster offers Ireena a simple home within the walls, and also offers to take the children to the orphanage. As they talk, PCs notice a man getting drawn by guards into the back of the burgomaster's mansion, he looks unhappy, which is why he was arrested.</li>
  <li>PCs decide to take Ireena with them instead of leaving her within the city.</li>
  <li>PCs return to Blue Water Inn to look for NPCs who can help them obtain silver. They ended up asking Yevgen and Szoldar from the Inn, who charges them "guard fees" PCs refuse and ask them where to find silver. Bangdrum wets his hand with holy water and feels a certain warmth when he touches Vasili's back. Vasili gets shocked and is still drawn by Ireena's beauty.</li>
  <li>The party splits, with the Draghorn brothers sleeping at the Inn, and the rest of the party sleeping at the church. Bangdrum sends Rictavio to warn the PCs about the strange reaction of Holy Water with Vasili.</li>
  <li>PCs rest.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Day 6</i></p>
<ol>
  <li>PCs wake up and meet by the church where they set off to the Winery.</li>
  <li>Ravens were encountered along the road to the Winery. The ravens tail the players until they reach the fork on the road near the winery at around 6pm.</li>
  <li>A hooded figure meets the party. He introduces himself as Damien Martikov, Urwin's father.</li>
  <li>Damien explains that druids have taken over the winery, and they promise to assist the players if they help take it back. The Martikovs are a family of wereravens who call themselves "Keepers of the Feather", a group that secretly opposes Strahd's rule.</li>
  <li>Players accept and they slowly make their way to the Wizard of the Wines Winery. The players are attacked by a large group of needle, twig, and vine blights. Druids were also in the attack.</li>
  <li>Players eventually kill the final druid, who drops a <a href="https://noads.5e.tools/items.html#gulthias%20staff_cos">Gulthias Staff</a>, triggering the death of blights within range.</li>
  <li>PCs obtain the staff and some loot. Martikovs then explain the reason for the Winery's good wine—magic gems. The first gem was stolen years ago and was not tracked. The second gem was stolen by Baba Lysaga, who attacked the Winery 2 months ago with animated Scarecrows. The last gem was stolen by the druids who attacked. PCs were not able to find the gem in the attack. Martikovs plan to attack Yester Hill to recover the gems and re-establish their Winery as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>PCs were offered to rest within the winery for the night.</li>
