<h2>Lightsinger's Aristocrats</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The assassination attempt on Mirt left him unfocused and unable to continue his role as Shemshime for that night's show. Upon knowing this, Birdflu enthusiastically volunteered and was given the part. Meanwhile, tied in front of Mirt and the Ultrævils is the melting simulacrum of whom Mirt suspected to be Manshoon. While the caster of the simulacrum spell remains to be unknown, the Ultrævils suppose that it was someone who hated Manshoon enough to frame him of a murder. Mirt has no output and was undecided, as info is still lacking.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the night went on, Birdflu performed his heart out on stage. Full of inspiration, he swayed the hearts of the crowd as he played the trapped villain, Shemshime. Meanwhile, Raven, Flinch and Chase kept their eye on the aristocrats of Waterdeep as they supported their family member. Raven feigned going to the restroom to spy on the Gralhunds, who were rumored to be connected to the Zhentarim. While she walked in the aisle, she heard a loud complaint from Orond Gralhund as Umpok the bartender accidentally spilled water all over his pants. He and his bodyguard left for the comfort rooms, leaving his wife, Yalah Gralhund, alone. By this time Raven had “gone to the restroom” and is by the lobby, readying herself to return back to her seat. Chase on the other hand, tailed Orond by feigning going to the restroom as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Raven now on her way back, was suddenly intercepted by Victoro Cassalanter as she passed by them. Victoro wants to meet the Ultrævils&nbsp;for financial matters. At the same time, Raven noticed Zardoz Zord wink at Yalah. Raven told Victoro that she'd take the message and she went back to her seat. Raven sent Owlbert to spy on what Yalah and Zardoz were up to as she sat back and watched the show.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chase was by the front lobby when he saw Zardoz and Yalah emerging from behind some decorative suits of armor and plants. Owlbert was also here, looking particularly shocked if he could probably show it. Through Owlbert's eyes, Raven just saw Yalah and Zardoz making out. Chase was pretty suspicious about this, so he further tailed Yalah's wife, Orund, whom he stumbled into by the theater hall just before they could come back to their seats. Through small talk about the clumsy bartender, Umpok, Chase was able to know a few stuff about the Gralhunds. Yalah was expected to be “promoted” to some high position but unfortunately didn't. The Gralhunds were not happy about this, but they kept on attending events such as this one to keep their presence known in the city. Orund was unaware of the affair that was going on.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The show was nearing its end and Birdflu was putting up a nice show so far, however, a slight misstep towards the end caused him to slur a bit and mix up some lines. Overall, the show was a success despite the change in actor. Birdflu was a bit disappointed about his performance even though it was a success, but one of the people in the crowd took notice of him and approached him when the curtains closed. It was non other than Zardoz's accompaniment, Margo Verida, who introduced herself to Birdflu. She wanted to get Birdflu's full name, saying that she wants to meet with him sometime, and that she will keep in touch via a paper bird. Birdflu gave his details, and went to the front lobby with the rest of the family, thinking he just got invited to a threesome. As the Ultrævils&nbsp;passed Yalah, Birdflu heard news of what happened from Raven and the others, and after recieving a snooty look from Yalah, Birdflu placed his hand on Yalah's shoulder and said “<i>I know”. </i>Yalah was in shock, and her eyes followed the Ultrævils&nbsp;as they went to the front lobby.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the front lobby, the Cassalanters were waiting for the Ultrævils&nbsp;and requested Umpok to get some wine. When the family got there, the Cassalanters expressed interest in offering the Ultrævils&nbsp;one of three things, a loan (with interest), an investment to the establishment they will create in Trollskull Alley, or the purchase of Trollskull Manor. The Ultrævils&nbsp;do not want to sell their home, but were interested by the former offers. Victoro wanted 5% of the profits if they were to give a certain sum of capital amounting to half the total expenses of the manor (625 gold pieces). Birdflu and Flinch were not so excited with this amount, and lowered it to 3%. Victoro was hesitant to accept, but Birdflu convinced him to. The rate was set to 3%. As their conversation drew, the Ultrævils managed to get an invitation to Ammalia's upcoming Founder's Day Feast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before the night was over, Birdflu joined the Harpers and got 60 gold pieces from Mirt as payment. Not quite happy with his performance, Birdflu decided to treat the rest of his family to a night of drinking at a nearby bar. And that they did, after leaving the Lightsinger Theater. They arrived at Trollskull Manor afterwards and got to sleep.</p>
<h2>Hired Help?</h2>

</figure>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;were preparing to go to the Southern Ward the next day when a knock resounded at door. There were three Half-orcs asking if they needed some help with Trollskull Manor. The orcs were looking for jobs around the city, and they approached Trollskull Manor in hopes of catching jobs as servers or cooks. They were interviewed by the Ultrævils, who immediately asked them if they went to <i>Frewn's Brews</i> and asked there. The three Orcs, who were named Gollik, Yambul, and Duftthug, denied ever going to Frewn's Brews, and said that they don't know the owner. They were met with suspicion, and were told to return after 9 days, when the renovations for the Manor gets finished. After telling off the three orcs, the Ultrævils&nbsp;were off to meet with the Emerald Enclave.</p>
<h2>Lady Phaulkon of the Enclave</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Phaulkonmere is mainly a druid compound centered around a large tree. There were an assortment of buildings here, mainly shops, and most of these shops sold herbs and plants. Flinch bought a sunflower for 5 cp, while Birdflu, on the other hand, managed to pry into the flower shop owner's <i>other</i> product. Birdflu was offered a small sachet of minced <i>Ganja</i> (as he called it by a street name) for 1 gold piece. At first he complained about the small amount that he got, to which the vendor explained was a supply issue. Birdflu came up with the idea of offering grass in Trollskull's soon to be taphouse. He convinced the shopkeeper to sell the grass for 8 sp to him, in exchange for the opportunity to sell more in Trollskull Alley. The shopkeeper agreed, and they shook hands on the deal.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right on cue, a cough broke the commotion (the vendor immediately reverted to advertising his flowers) and introduced himself as <strong>Melannor Felbranch</strong><i><strong> </strong></i>the person who send the talking cat at the Ultrævils. The family followed him into the faction building, which was made of smooth stone with plants dangling from the windowsills. A disembodied female voice talked to the Ultrævils, who introduced herself as <strong>Jeryth Phaulkon</strong>. Jeryth is the leader of the Emerald Enclave, and extends here invitation to the family. The Enclave offers them companions, blessings, and the ability to request Jeryth to cast any leveled Druid spell should the need arise. While they were talking, Melannor spoke of some scarecrows terrorizing the farming ward, and if the Ultrævils&nbsp;were up to the task, he would give it to them should one of them join. At this point, the Ultrævils&nbsp;were still undecided, and turned down the job. Birdflu was the only one who had a faction at this point, and the harper pin on his chest gleamed proudly along with his blue-and-gold cape. The Ultrævils&nbsp;exited Phaulkonmere, promising a reply of their decision soon.</p>
<h2>An Unlikely Witness</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the visit to the Southern Ward, the Ultrævils&nbsp;still had plenty of time to assist with Birdflu's first mission from the Harpers: finding an eyewitness to the identity and location of two Zhents. There reports of a talking horse around the city of Waterdeep named Maxeene, who pull one of the city's drays. It took the Ultrævils&nbsp;around 5 hours to find her among the city's bustling winter streets, after the Ultrævils&nbsp;witnessed one dray not moving, and the driver cursing at the horse.</p>

</figure>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;struck up a conversation with the horse, who whispered back. It was confirmed to be Maxeene. The driver doesn't seem to know that he is the owner of a talking horse, and Maxeene didn't seem to want him to know either. Other customers noticed, however, that Maxeene sometimes scoffs and comments about the people riding her dray, leading to one Harper overhearing something about Zhentarims. The Ultrævils&nbsp;also didn't want the driver to know, thus they struck up a bargain with him. They would buy his horse in exchange for a new riding horse. Maxeene was a draft horse, but the Ultrævils&nbsp;found grew found of her and decided to adopt her, naming her Maxeene Ultrævil. After the horse exchange, Maxeene was free to talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maxeene recalled picking up two Zhentarim agents from Gralhund Villa. One of them was a half-orc female whom she dropped off at the Yawning Portal. Unfortunately, she couldn't remember the other place she dropped off the other Zhent. They were identified to be Yagra Stonefist, and Davil Starsong. The Ultrævils&nbsp;immediately decided to head to the Yawning Portal to see if Yagra was still there. She was. However, Davil was not here. On the bright side, the quest was almost done, as they have identified and located one of the Zhents.</p>
