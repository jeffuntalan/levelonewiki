<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The family had the butcher cornered. All exits were covered, and Raven even managed to paralyze Thrakkus with a Hold Person spell. Within 12 seconds, Thrakkus was tied down to chopping table and questioned. Some questions involved the use of some violent “persuading”, which proved effective in breaking Thrakkus. Aric decided to turn a blind eye on this activity, as the prospect of tracking down the Stone of Golorr and its rumored riches could be of great help to their cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thrakkus revealed that he was instructed to transfer the stone to one of his shipments to a place called “Cuttle's Meat Pies”. Thrakkus was also asked about his intentions, his affiliates, and about his client. Thrakkus told the family that he works as the Zhentarim's “butcher”, disposing of dead bodies by selling them as meat. Yalah knew of this and Thrakkus explained further that Yalah often sends bodies his way. He chops them up in ways that make them indistinguishable from actual cuts of pork or beef. Furthermore, he explained that he did this job because of the rampant poverty in the area. He needed the money.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, Robin brought the commoner he disabled from the other room. His name is Bob, and he attested that he did know about the meat, although he only did it because he had no where else to go. Money and resources is scarce in the Field ward, and he did it to survive. Raven patched him up and fixed his broken legs, and the family offered him a job at their Tavern. Bob can't read, let alone write. The family told him that he can either be a waiter, or just serve as a janitor. After settling Bob's fate, Aric blew on his signal horn to summon the Watchers, and after a few minutes, they arrived. Aric explained what happened and the Watch took away Thrakkus. The family went on to pursue the delivery cart. Thrakkus said that is was gone not 30 minutes ago, and it may face delays due to the hash winds of the blizzard raging over Waterdeep.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cuttle's Meat Pies</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With their family carriage crowded, Flinch and Birdflu commandeered the horses at maximum speed to the location of Cuttle's Meat Pies in the Trades Ward. The family got off upon arrival, missing the delivery cart, but not by long. The cart's tracks were fresh and not covered by the snow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sign Cuttle's Meat Pies can be barely seen through the snow. Peregrine, Robin, and Orpheus sneak back to the shop's back door while the rest of the family go to the front. Birdflu, Raven, Shrike and Aric meet Mrs. Cuttle, an old human woman who invited them in. As they conversed, Aric and the others questioned her about her product and its ingredients. From what they've gathered, Mrs. Cuttle does not know that the meat pies that she makes have questionable meat in them. Birdflu and Aric eventually inform Mrs. Cuttle that Thrakkus was arrested on charges linked to his meat consisting of dead body parts. This triggers Mrs. Cuttle, who is extremely disgusted and ashamed of what she had been a part of. She starts crying, throwing the pies that she made aside, away from her view. Raven comforted her, and Birdflu checked the backrooms for any sign of the stone.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When she had calmed down, she detailed more about the shipments. She also detailed that the delivery cart would sometimes stop by her neighbor's house for some time before delivering her the meat she ordered. She also told them that it was these same neighbor's who suggested that she order from Thrakkus, quoting low prices for the meat. Mrs. Cuttle's neighbors were described to always be wearing dark clothing, and described to be a man and a female elf. Aric, Igor, and Birdlflu decided to check the neighbor's house, while Shrike, Robin, Peregrine, and Orpheus guarded the back door of the neighbor's house. Upon checking for clues, the overheard the words “stone” and “Thrakkus” being spoken inside.</p>
<h2>Another Zhent Hideout</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin had the idea of feigning collapse after knocking at the back door so they could take a look inside. Peregrine and Shrike were on board with this idea and were on standby. Robin commenced his plan and knocked. A man answered the door, and Robin collapsed, asking for food and water, at the man's feet. The man was surprised to see this, but held the door at an angle, preventing Robin from seeing inside properly. He did get a glimpse of a woman near the front door.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aric and and Igor decided to also knock on the front door. However, this made the people inside suspicious. Robin, still lying prone near the back door, heard running footsteps approaching him. Out back, footprints can be seen in the snow. Peregrine noticed that an invisible figure had leaped over Robin, and is now making an escape attempt. He and Orpheus tried to grapple the said figure, but failed. The invisible figure is a bit discernible due to the snow, and is now climbing a ladder to the rooftops. The family immediately followed.</p>
<h2>A Rooftop Chase?</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The female elf is not visible as her invisibility wore off. She is around 60 feet away from the family, nearly out of visible range due to the heavy snowfall. Robin traipsed over the rooftops, taking extra care not to slip, and started shooting arrows at their quarry. Robin's arrows missed his target. Birdflu cast Bane on their quarry, but the elf managed to resist it. Finally, Shrike ran with incredible speed attributing to his Avian Agility, and managed to catch up to the elf. He grappled the elf, and with an impressive feat of strength, managed to subdue the running Zhent. The chase lasted for a mere 6 seconds, and the elf named Vevette Blackwater, was in their custody.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Delivery for Manshoon</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vevette was brought down to their hideout, where Igor and Aric were waiting, watching over the apprehended individuals there. A total of four people were in the hideout at the time. Vevette Blackwater, Avareen Windrivver (Human Male), Zorbog Jyarkoth, (Human Male), and a bound dwarf by the name of Ott Steeltoes. Ott Steeltoes was bound from the shoulders down to a chair. He was also gagged, and is wearing a hat with weird stalks sprouting from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon searching Vevette, the family found what they were looking for. The Stone of Golorr was finally in their hands. They questioned Vevette about it, but she told them nothing they already know. She had a confident demeanor to her, and she frequently told the family that they shouldn't have gotten involved with the stone as Manshoon will be expecting it delivered to him. Manshoon would likely hunt the players down for this, she added. Vevette was very tightly-lipped about her intentions, even with extra “persuasion”. Her accomplices on the other hand, were not so similar. Under the threat of “persuasion”, one of them named Avareen snitched and told them info about Manshoon. Manshoon is rumored to be a very powerful wizard, and is known as the founder of the Zhentarim. The stone was to be delivered to him at the Kolat Towers in the Southern Ward.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vevette was especially disgusted about this wavering in loyalty and was evidently affected. She had lost her confidence, only stating that Manshoon will surely come after the family now. The family has yet to decide to kill her, or to hand her over to the Blackstaff of Waterdeep. On the other hand, Avareen, Zorbog, and Ott were given a second chance and were invited to work for the family. Avareen was met with some hostility though, as he is seen as a likely snitch. Ott Steeltoes was a Xanathar's Guild member, he detailed that it was his job to swap out Xanathar's goldfish whenever it died. It was a stressful job, as he needed to be extremely careful that the goldfish be identical to the last one, and that he could do it without the all-seeing beholder knowing. He also expressed his dislike of working with Zorbog and Avareen, as they captured him and tied him up but was open to the idea of leaving the Guild for a better job.</p>
