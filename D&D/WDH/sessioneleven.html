<h2>Caught Red-handed</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The family had the butcher cornered. All exits were covered, and Raven even managed to paralyze Thrakkus with a Hold Person spell. Within 12 seconds, Thrakkus was tied down to chopping table and questioned. Some questions involved the use of some violent “persuading”, which proved effective in breaking Thrakkus. Aric decided to turn a blind eye on this activity, as the prospect of tracking down the Stone of Golorr and its rumored riches could be of great help to their cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thrakkus revealed that he was instructed to transfer the stone to one of his shipments to a place called “Cuttle's Meat Pies”. Thrakkus was also asked about his intentions, his affiliates, and about his client. Thrakkus told the family that he works as the Zhentarim's “butcher”, disposing of dead bodies by selling them as meat. Yalah knew of this and Thrakkus explained further that Yalah often sends bodies his way. He chops them up in ways that make them indistinguishable from actual cuts of pork or beef. Furthermore, he explained that he did this job because of the rampant poverty in the area. He needed the money.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, Robin brought the commoner he disabled from the other room. His name is Bob, and he attested that he did know about the meat, although he only did it because he had no where else to go. Money and resources is scarce in the Field ward, and he did it to survive. Raven patched him up and fixed his broken legs, and the family offered him a job at their Tavern. Bob can't read, let alone write. The family told him that he can either be a waiter, or just spread false rumors in the streets. After settling Bob's fate, Aric blew on his signal horn to summon the Watchers, and after a few minutes, they arrived. Aric explained what happened and the Watch took away Thrakkus. The family went on to pursue the delivery cart. Thrakkus said that is was gone not 30 minutes ago, and it may face delays due to the hash winds of the blizzard raging over Waterdeep.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cuttle's Meat Pies</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With their family carriage crowded, Flinch and Birdflu commandeered the horses at maximum speed to the location of Cuttle's Meat Pies in the Trades Ward.&nbsp;</p>
