<h2>The Lost Construct</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was a typical day for <strong>Aric Shun Megævil</strong>, a member of the City Watch, and his shield-brother <strong>Igor Yagvah Megævil</strong>. They were patrolling the streets of the Southern Ward, doing about their duties. Both of them were from the far region of Rashemen, a region in Northeast Faerûn known as the Land of Berserkers. They went to Waterdeep over six months ago, in search for a cure for their supreme leader Lenki Pangibredo. Their search proved to be a long one, and dwindling resources required them to get jobs to continue their search. Their temperament proved to be an asset to the City Watch, who absorbed Aric into their ranks after a few short weeks of training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They continued with their patrol that morning, up until 10 AM, when they bore witness to a nimblewright being cornered by what appeared to be thugs of the black network in an alley close to the market. The nimblewright appeared to be already damaged, and with a bad leg, it could only push itself further into the stack of crates that blocked part of the alley. Aric intervened by talking to the thugs, but in response they just told Aric to mind his business. Seeing that there is no peaceful way to settle this score, Igor and Aric decided to exchange blows with the violent thugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The thugs proved no match for the well-trained duo. One of the thugs was knocked unconscious, another was successfully apprehended, while the third thug managed to get away. The nimblewright was also taken into custody of the Southern Ward's City Watch.<br>&nbsp;</p>
