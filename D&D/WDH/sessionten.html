<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was a typical day for <strong>Aric Shun Megævil</strong>, a member of the City Watch, and his shield-brother <strong>Igor Yagvah Megævil</strong>. They were patrolling the streets of the Southern Ward, doing about their duties. Both of them were from the far region of Rashemen, a region in Northeast Faerûn known as the Land of Berserkers. They went to Waterdeep over six months ago, in search for a cure for their supreme leader Lenki Pangibredo. Their search proved to be a long one, and dwindling resources required them to get jobs to continue their search. Their temperament proved to be an asset to the City Watch, who absorbed Aric into their ranks after a few short weeks of training.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They continued with their patrol that morning, up until 10 AM, when they bore witness to a nimblewright being cornered by what appeared to be thugs of the black network in an alley close to the market. The nimblewright appeared to be already damaged, and with a bad leg, it could only push itself further into the stack of crates that blocked part of the alley. Aric intervened by talking to the thugs, but in response they just told Aric to mind his business. Seeing that there is no peaceful way to settle this score, Igor and Aric decided to exchange blows with the violent thugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The thugs proved no match for the well-trained duo. One of the thugs was knocked unconscious, another was successfully apprehended, while the third thug managed to get away. The nimblewright was also taken into custody of the Southern Ward's City Watch.</p>
<h2>The Unexpected Guest</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was evening and the family had just off talking to a few local gossips when a knock on the front door sounded. Birdflu opened the door to find a very wounded individual barely holding herself up in front of him. She asked to see Robin, which Birdflu called.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin recognized here immediately as this individual is Istrid Horn, the person giving him the Zhent missions. Istrid explained to Robin that the Zhents are in no shape to be running around the streets right now as they are being actively apprehended for the Bloodbath at Gralhund Villa. Istrid also pointed out that there were reports of Zhents chasing a nimblewright which is thought to have been the Gralhund's. The nimblewright was last seen in the Southern Ward before being taken into custody by the City Watch. After hearing her tale, Robin decided to help her out. Raven also healed her in the meantime. She was led upstairs to have her long rest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The new information that Istrid brought left the Ultrævils to decide what their next step would be. Tomorrow would be the penultimate day for the preparation of Nottelere Tavern. On the other hand, the Gralhund nimblewright might have the Stone of Golor, an item that may promise them wealth if found.The Ultrævils decided to pursue the reported nimblewright in the Southern Ward after they get their good night's sleep.</p>
<h2>An Extended Family</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next morning, the Ultrævils prepared their horse and carriage for their trips down south while poring over some unfinished faction quests. They decided to put them on hold for now as other matters needed more attention. After a quick breakfast, they were on their way.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Southern Ward's City Watch Headquarters was a similar structure to the one present in the North Ward. The front desk officer here was a female dwarf named Linda who sat on a tall stool behind her desk. The Ultrævils requested for information about the nimblewright in custody, but the lady would not give them anything as they were not involved with the nimblewright in any degree. Birdflu stepped in and convinced the dwarf that they know the nimblewright and have been searching for him. After Linda was successfully persuaded, she led them to the officer handling the case of the nimblewright.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aric is a dragonborn, and his large stature made him stick out like a sore thumb out of the mostly dwarven officers in the Southern Headquarters. Linda introduced the Ultrævils to Aric Shun Megævil, who stood up and met them to attend to their needs. The Ultrævils thanked Linda and asked Aric about some details concerning the nimblewright in custody. The Ultrævils and Megævils soon realize that they were in fact, related! Aric introduced them to his shield-brother, Igor Yagvah Megævil, and recounted the tale of their arrival at Waterdeep. The family decided to talk in one of the questioning rooms about certain details on the nimblewright.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Face-to-face with the nimblewright, the both branches of the family exchanged information about the nimblewright, including some details about the Bloodbath at Gralhund Villa, the nimblewright's escape, and the possibility of it bearing a stone of significant importance. Upon further questioning, they learned about the backstory of the nimblewright and how it was tasked to release the fireball in Trollskull Alley, escape with the stone of Golor, and finally drop-off the stone at the location marked on a map that Yalah gave them. After dropping off the stone, the nimblewright had no sense of purpose as no orders for its return were given. The nimblewright, who was called Nim, instead roamed across Waterdeep aimlessly.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aric had previously confiscated the map that the nimblewright had, and showed it to the rest of the family. It marked a location in the Field Ward with “Thrakkus” handwritten beside the X. The family debated on what to do next, and eventually decided to investigate the marked location. The opening of Nottelere Tavern also came up; Aric and Igor were invited to it. Other topics that came up were Nim's other “friends”, which they later learned were also nimblewright located in the House of Inspired Hands, a facility for tinkerers and artificers alike. Finally, the family decided to take custody of the Nim. Nim, being a construct with its own will and intellect was allowed to be a part of the family so long as they are willing to, and Nim is willing.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin reminded the family of some details regarding Thrakkus that he knew as a Zhent applicant: Thrakkus is a butcher, and he took care of bodies generated by Zhent missions.</p>
<h2>The Butcher of Field Ward</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The location marked in the map led the family to a dilapidated Windmill with faint lights glowing through the windows. The blizzard sweeping across Waterdeep is in full force, and the family cannot hear anything that comes from inside the windmill. Robin decided the scale the 30 foot windmill and try to get in via the windows at the 2nd floor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin got in easy enough, and the second floor was in bad shape. Some areas of the ceiling were on the brink of collapse, and while observing safety, Robin managed to squeeze in the time to pick the lock in one of the bedrooms and obtain a crossbow, some bolts, and some clothes. He threw his spoils down outside, Aric turning a blind eye on the blatant theft that happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin opened the door, letting his family in. The family sneaked inside, while Aric stayed outside to keep watch. The inside of the windmill and its connected building was in bad shape and is evidently not in any shape to be approved by any health inspector. Waste, litter, and moldy food littered the premises. The stench of some areas were enough to drive any visitor away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After splitting up and scanning the premises, Birdflu found himself face to face with two nervous inhabitants of the windmill. The two individuals were evidently scared of any mention of Thrakkus' name, but were able to details of the dragonborn's approximate whereabouts (either the Larder or the Butchery). The family grouped together, and went to the Larder first. They attacked the individual there, but the helpless commoner there was knocked unconscious after being targeted in the private parts. They moved to the Butchery, were Thrakkus currently is. He was immediately hostile, and the family retaliated in return.</p>
