<h2>The Lost Construct</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was a typical day for <strong>Aric Shun Megævil</strong>, a member of the City Watch, and his shield-brother <strong>Igor Yagvah Megævil</strong>. They were patrolling the streets of the Southern Ward, doing about their duties. Both of them were from the far region of Rashemen, a region in Northeast Faerûn known as the Land of Berserkers. They went to Waterdeep over six months ago, in search for a cure for their supreme leader Lenki Pangibredo. Their search proved to be a long one, and dwindling resources required them to get jobs to continue their search. Their temperament proved to be an asset to the City Watch, who absorbed Aric into their ranks after a few short weeks of training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They continued with their patrol that morning, up until 10 AM, when they bore witness to a nimblewright being cornered by what appeared to be thugs of the black network in an alley close to the market. The nimblewright appeared to be already damaged, and with a bad leg, it could only push itself further into the stack of crates that blocked part of the alley. Aric intervened by talking to the thugs, but in response they just told Aric to mind his business. Seeing that there is no peaceful way to settle this score, Igor and Aric decided to exchange blows with the violent thugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The thugs proved no match for the well-trained duo. One of the thugs was knocked unconscious, another was successfully apprehended, while the third thug managed to get away. The nimblewright was also taken into custody of the Southern Ward's City Watch.</p>
<h2>The Unexpected Guest</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was evening and the family had just off talking to a few local gossips when a knock on the front door sounded. Birdflu opened the door to find a very wounded individual barely holding herself up in front of him. She asked to see Robin, which Birdflu called.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin recognized here immediately as this individual is Istrid Horn, the person giving him the Zhent missions. Istrid explained to Robin that the Zhents are in no shape to be running around the streets right now as they are being actively apprehended for the Bloodbath at Gralhund Villa. Istrid also pointed out that there were reports of Zhents chasing a nimblewright which is thought to have been the Gralhund's. The nimblewright was last seen in the Southern Ward before being taken into custody by the City Watch. After hearing her tale, Robin decided to help her out. Raven also healed her in the meantime. She was led upstairs to have her long rest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The new information that Istrid brought left the Ultrævils to decide what their next step would be. Tomorrow would be the penultimate day for the preparation of Nottelere Tavern. On the other hand, the Gralhund nimblewright might have the Stone of Golor, an item that may promise them wealth if found.The Ultrævils decided to pursue the reported nimblewright in the Southern Ward after they get their good night's sleep.</p>
<h2>An Extended Family</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next morning, the Ultrævils prepared their horse and carriage for their trips down south while poring over some unfinished faction quests. They decided to put them on hold for now as other matters needed more attention. After a quick breakfast, they were on their way.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Southern Ward's City Watch Headquarters was a similar structure to the one present in the North Ward. The front desk officer here was a female dwarf who sat on a tall stool behind her desk.</p>
