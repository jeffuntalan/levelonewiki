<h2>The Lost Construct</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was a typical day for Aric Shun Megævil, a member of the City Watch, and his shield-brother Igor Yagvah Megævil. They were patrolling the streets of the Southern Ward, doing about their duties. Both of them were from the far region of Rashemen, a region in Northeast Faerûn known as the Land of Berserkers. They went to Waterdeep over six months ago, in search for a cure for their supreme leader Lenki Pangibredo. Their search proved to be a long one, and dwindling resources required them to get jobs to continue their search. Their temperament proved to be an asset to the City Watch, who gave Aric a position after a few short weekd of training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They continued with their patrol that morning, up until 10 AM, when they bore witness to a nimblewright being cornered by what appeared to be members of the black network.</p>
