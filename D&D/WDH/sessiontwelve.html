<h2>Hired Help</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With Vevette still in tow, the family decided to go to the Blackstaff Tower to meet with the head of the Force Grey, Vajra Safahr in order to properly hold Vevette captive. Vajra's office was at the very top of Blackstaff tower, which was only reachable through a system of teleportation portals. Upon reaching the top, a long hall led to Vajra's meeting area.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the family described the details of Vevette's capture, the threat of retaliation also came up and they requested the aid of Force Grey. Vajra was understandably taken aback at first of more news about Manshoon. She agreed to lend a hand to the family by giving their Tavern's opening a security detail of two Force Grey Veterans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vajra also asked them about Vevette's two companions as well as the captive dwarf named Ott Steeltoes. She brought up that these three could be classified as criminals as well and should be help captive. The family vouched for them and insisted that they will hand them over immediately should they be up to no good. Vajra was convinced of this proposition and allowed the family to hire them as additional help. After the discussions, the family went straight home.</p>
<h2>Preparations…</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the Manor, the family discussed matters on tomorrow's opening day, and who to invite. Their friends and allies shall be invited, this includes the leaders of their respective factions and their members. Volo, Renaer, and Floon shall be invited as well. As for the nobles, the family decided to include the Gralhunds on their invite list as a gesture of civility. The Cassalanters are also included in the list, as are the dungsweepers. The invitations were to be sent out by Avareen and Zorbog as the blizzard outside would not allow other means of sending them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Topics concerning the distribution of illegal drugs also came up as well, and was deemed far too dangerous given the invitation of members of the Watch as well. For janitorial matters, Bob was the man whil for cooking, it was agreed that Ott Steeltoes was to be the chef. All seemed to set for tomorrow's grand opening.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Looming Threat</h2>
