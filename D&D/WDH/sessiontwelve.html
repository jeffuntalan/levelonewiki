<h2>Hired Help</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With Vevette still in tow, the family decided to go to the Blackstaff Tower to meet with the head of the Force Grey, Vajra Safahr in order to properly hold Vevette captive. Vajra's office was at the very top of Blackstaff tower, which was only reachable through a system of teleportation portals. Upon reaching the top, a long hall led to Vajra's meeting area.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the family described the details of Vevette's capture, the threat of retaliation also came up and they requested the aid of Force Grey. Vajra was understandably taken aback at first of more news about Manshoon. She agreed to lend a hand to the family by giving their Tavern's opening a security detail of two Force Grey Veterans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vajra also asked them about Vevette's two companions as well as the captive dwarf named Ott Steeltoes. She brought up that these three could be classified as criminals as well and should be help captive. The family vouched for them and insisted that they will hand them over immediately should they be up to no good. Vajra was convinced of this proposition and allowed the family to hire them as additional help. After the discussions, the family went straight home.</p>
