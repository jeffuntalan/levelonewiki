<h2>Hired Help</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With Vevette still in tow, the family decided to go to the Blackstaff Tower to meet with the head of the Force Grey, Vajra Safahr in order to properly hold Vevette captive. Vajra's office was at the very top of Blackstaff tower, which was only reachable through a system of teleportation portals. Upon reaching the top, a long hall led to Vajra's meeting area.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the family described the details of Vevette's capture, the threat of retaliation also came up and they requested the aid of Force Grey. Vajra was understandably taken aback at first of more news about Manshoon. She agreed to lend a hand to the family by giving their Tavern's opening a security detail of two Force Grey Veterans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vajra also asked them about Vevette's two companions as well as the captive dwarf named Ott Steeltoes. She brought up that these three could be classified as criminals as well and should be help captive. The family vouched for them and insisted that they will hand them over immediately should they be up to no good. Vajra was convinced of this proposition and allowed the family to hire them as additional help. After the discussions, the family went straight home.</p>
<h2>Preparations…</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the Manor, the family discussed matters on tomorrow's opening day, and who to invite. Their friends and allies shall be invited, this includes the leaders of their respective factions and their members. Volo, Renaer, and Floon shall be invited as well. As for the nobles, the family decided to include the Gralhunds on their invite list as a gesture of civility. The Cassalanters are also included in the list, as are the dungsweepers. The invitations were to be sent out by Avareen and Zorbog as the blizzard outside would not allow other means of sending them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Topics concerning the distribution of illegal drugs also came up as well, and was deemed far too dangerous given the invitation of members of the Watch as well. For janitorial matters, Bob was the man while for cooking, it was agreed that Ott Steeltoes was to be the chef. All seemed to set for tomorrow's grand opening.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Looming Threat</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some of the family members were asleep, when suddenly Raven noticed a loud thud on the Manor's roof. Orpheus noticed this as well, and he immediately woke Flinch. Raven looked out the window and saw a winged snake clutching with what appears to be a note wrapped in leather, tied to it. Raven took suspicion and immediately fire a <i>Guiding Bolt</i> at it. Meanwhile, Flinch flew through the blizzard, and attempted to intercept the flying snake.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Guiding Bolt</i> hit the flying snake dead on, and it was reduced to ash. Flinch salvaged the remains of the letter, making out only the words:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i><strong>…Vevette's thugs…Trollskull…</strong></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flinch flew back to the manor to show his sister what he retrieved. They decided to bring it up with the family the next day.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once Flinch let the other family members see what happened, Robin immediately knew what was up. The flying snake belonged to none other than Istrid Horn, his primary contact within the Zhentarim. Istrid is currently here at the manor, and could have tried to contact Manshoon. Robin ran upstairs, as did Raven, Igor, Flinch, and Shrike. Everyone ran up the entryway and stairs to the third floor except Shrike, who decided to climb up the window.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin decided to go first to confront his mentor while the family waited out for a bit. Istrid was reading a book at the third floor study when Robin confronted her. The dwarf looked at him and they conversed for a bit, Robin bringing up how they took her in and asked her how she was. Instrid answered this calmly.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin pondered, but after a while he drew his weapon and attacked Istrid! Istrid saw this coming and picked up her maul behind the chair she was sitting on. The family heard the commotion and ran upstairs. Shrike broke in through the window, but with regard to the glass in order to not damage it. Flinch dashed in, but before he could help, a spiritual weapon in the shape of a large maul appeared between him and Robin. Raven and Igor ran up the flight of stairs, Raven casting Hold Person to incapacitate Istrid. After a few moments of skirmish, Istrid was incapacitated by Raven's spell, and tied to her chair.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robin questioned Istrid of her intentions, to which she told Robin that Manshoon has taken over Zhentarim once more and that he needs the stone. Istrid continued to say that she holds the title, Master of Trade and Coin in the Zhentarim and that she ranks high in the Zhents. She further told robin that he should join their cause instead of keeping the stone for themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly, Istrid was stabbed multiple times. Her blood pooled on the carpet as Robin repeatedly went at her throat and torso. Within a few seconds, Istrid was dead, still tied to her chair. Robin looked down at the floor, and ran to his room.</p>
