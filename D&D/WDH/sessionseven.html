<h2>Opposite Invitations</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was early evening at the Yawning Portal, and Birdflu has his eyes set on Yagra eating a sandwich by the well to Undermountain. He and his family had been tracking down the whereabouts of two Zhent agents, and they've found one of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The other members of the family started ordering some food while asking Bonnie some questions about the other Zhent agent, Davil Starsong. Bonnie told Flinch, Shrike, and Raven that Davil stayed at one of the rooms in the Yawning Portal, but hasn't been here today. She also mentioned that Davil and Yagra always meet here every night. Bonnie went back to the kitchen after taking their orders and answering a few questions. After a while, Yagra finished her sandwich and started walking to the bar. Birdflu followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bright lights in the Yawning Portal did not help Birdflu much with staying discreet, neither did his royal blue Harper cape. Yagra didn't notice him, but one person from the crowd did: Jalester Silvermane. Jalester approached Birdflu with the intent of inviting him to join the Lord's Alliance, failing to notice Birdflu's Harper Pin. He was immediately turned down by Birdflu, who was quite annoyed that he was getting bothered while observing Yagra. He referred his other family members to Jalester.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, Bonnie returned to the Ultrævils' table with their orders and was immediately questioned once more by Flinch who was inquiring about Davil's likely whereabouts. Bonnie simple replied that she doesn't know, but they may ask someone who does. Before the Ultrævils could react, Bonnie called out for Yagra who seated by the bar. Everyone at the table was surprised at the sudden callout; Yagra approached the table.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bonnie explained to Yagra that the Ultrævils&nbsp;were looking for Davil. Yagra eyed them suspiciously, but decided that they didn't look threatening. She asked the seated adventurers why they were looking for Davil, to which they replied that one of them was interested in joining the Zhents. Yagra was surprised and started to talk in a hushed voice. She told the characters that Davil isn't available right now because he was preoccupied for matters she didn't want to discuss. She told the players to wait here at the Yawning Portal. With those words, Yagra bid them goodbye and returned to the bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jalester visited the table a few moments later, inviting the players over to join the Lord's Alliance. Flinch asked about the benefits of joining the faction. Jalester told them that members of the alliance each get a red-gold cape that is easily recognized by people (CHA advantage), as well as the ability to ask Waterdeep civilians and the city watch to assist you in times of need (combat). Members may also ask for a meeting with the Open Lord, should the need arise. Flinch expressed his desire to join, and told Jalester that he will be hearing from him soon. Meanwhile, Birdflu returned to the table and was informed by the the others about what Yagra told them. Robin was nowhere to be found the whole time.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The family was now discussing the matter of what to report back to the Harpers. Birdflu felt that the task was still incomplete, and that they needed to locate Davil in order for the quest to be deemed complete. Flinch felt that knowing their common whereabouts was enough. The decision was settled via a vote, and ultimately the Ultrævils&nbsp;decided to track down Davil. They used up their remaining paper bird to write Davil's name, and used their horses to keep up with the paper bird. Flinch also used the light spell to make the paper bird easily discernible amidst the night sky.</p>
<h2>Evening Eavesdropping</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compared to the sewers where space was cramped and the paper bird flew in a limited space, keeping up with it in the open air proved to be a difficult task. Despite this, the Ultrævils&nbsp;managed to barely spot where it went. They were in the North Ward, that's for sure, and the place where the paper bird went was a walled off property just a few blocks away from Trollskull Manor.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;heard laughter from the inside, and they assumed that they got the paper bird with the dirty note inside it. This further confirmed their suspicion that this was in fact, the Gralhund Villa. Birdflu knocked on the door of what seemed to be the garage of the villa. A thuggish figure opened the door, and inside they could see a carriage, and two other figure. These two other figures had their backs turned against them, exposing</p>
