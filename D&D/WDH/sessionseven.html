<h2>Opposite Invitations</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was early evening at the Yawning Portal, and Birdflu has his eyes set on Yagra eating a sandwich by the well to Undermountain. He and his family had been tracking down the whereabouts of two Zhent agents, and they've found one of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The other members of the family started ordering some food while asking Bonnie some questions about the other Zhent agent, Davil Starsong. Bonnie told Flinch, Shrike, and Raven that Davil stayed at one of the rooms in the Yawning Portal, but hasn't been here today. She also mentioned that Davil and Yagra always meet here every night. Bonnie went back to the kitchen after taking their orders and answering a few questions. After a while, Yagra finished her sandwich and started walking to the bar. Birdflu followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bright lights in the Yawning Portal did not help Birdflu much with staying discreet, neither did his royal blue Harper cape. Yagra didn't notice him, but one person from the crowd did: Jalester Silvermane. Jalester approached Birdflu with the intent of inviting him to join the Lord's Alliance, failing to notice Birdflu's Harper Pin. He was immediately turned down by Birdflu, who was quite annoyed that he was getting bothered while observing Yagra. He referred his other family members to Jalester.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, Bonnie returned to the Ultrævils' table with their orders and was immediately questioned once more by Flinch who was inquiring about Davil's likely whereabouts. Bonnie simple replied that she doesn't know, but they may ask someone who does. Before the Ultrævils could react, Bonnie called out for Yagra who seated by the bar. Everyone at the table was surprised at the sudden callout; Yagra approached the table.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bonnie explained to Yagra that the Ultrævils&nbsp;were looking for Davil. Yagra eyed them suspiciously, but decided that they didn't look threatening. She asked the seated adventurers why they were looking for Davil, to which they replied that one of them was interested in joining the Zhents. Yagra was surprised and started to talk in a hushed voice. She told the characters that Davil isn't available right now because he was preoccupied for matters she didn't want to discuss. She told the players to wait here at the Yawning Portal. With those words, Yagra bid them goodbye and returned to the bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jalester visited the table a few moments later, inviting the players over to join the Lord's Alliance. Flinch asked about the benefits of joining the faction. Jalester told them that members of the alliance each get a red-gold cape that is easily recognized by people (CHA advantage), as well as the ability to ask Waterdeep civilians and the city watch to assist you in times of need (combat). Members may also ask for a meeting with the Open Lord, should the need arise. Flinch expressed his desire to join, and told Jalester that he will be hearing from him soon. Meanwhile, Birdflu returned to the table and was informed by the the others about what Yagra told them. Robin was nowhere to be found the whole time.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The family was now discussing the matter of what to report back to the Harpers. Birdflu felt that the task was still incomplete, and that they needed to locate Davil in order for the quest to be deemed complete. Flinch felt that knowing their common whereabouts was enough. The decision was settled via a vote, and ultimately the Ultrævils&nbsp;decided to track down Davil. They used up their remaining paper bird to write Davil's name, and used their horses to keep up with the paper bird. Flinch also used the light spell to make the paper bird easily discernible amidst the night sky.</p>
<h2>Evening Eavesdropping</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compared to the sewers where space was cramped and the paper bird flew in a limited space, keeping up with it in the open air proved to be a difficult task. Despite this, the Ultrævils&nbsp;managed to barely spot where it went. They were in the North Ward, that's for sure, and the place where the paper bird went was a walled off property just a few blocks away from Trollskull Manor.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;heard laughter from the inside, and they assumed that they got the paper bird with the dirty note inside it. This further confirmed their suspicion that this was in fact, the Gralhund Villa. Birdflu knocked on the door of what seemed to be the garage of the villa. A thuggish figure opened the door, and inside they could see a carriage, and two other figure. These two other figures had their backs turned against them, exposing their neck tattoos in the shape of a flying snake. These people are Zhents.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Birflu feigned asking for directions from the thug who opened the door. The thug nonchalantly gave directions to Birdflu's inquiry and immediately turned them down on any more inquiries, insisting that they should go. The doors slammed shut, and the Ultrævils&nbsp;heard nothing else but the crunching of the snow on the empty street as they tread along. As they approached the walls however, Raven heard voices coming from the other side.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Curious about the conversation over the wall, the family decided to eavesdrop using a very comic method. Shrike boosted Flinch over the wall, and Flinch listened in on the conversation. Nearly 5 feet off the ground, Shrike and Flinch's teamwork allowed Flinch to peer over and see the figures engaged in conversation. Walking in the snow-trodden path was Yalah and Orond Gralhund, as well as Hrabbaz their bodyguard. A fourth figure was walking alongside them, listening to Yalah. This figure was a half-elf, whom they could only assume as Davil. Yalah seemed furious about something.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="text-small"><i><strong><u>Yalah:</u> "I don't care about what you're doing! Where is Urstul? Have him come by here immediately! That stone isn't gonna find itself!"</strong></i></span><br><br><span class="text-small"><i><strong><u>Orond: </u></strong>"Yalah, please calm down. I'm sure Urstul has been keen on finding the stone." Orond tells her.</i></span><br><br><span class="text-small"><i><strong><u>Yalah</u>:</strong> "Something is up. I just know it. Ahk, this long silence from Urstul is making me worry. I'm having wrinkles on my face, don't I Orond? Anyway, Davil I want you to find out what Mirt is up to. I noticed that he swapped with another actor in the middle of the performance last night. Get me information about what&nbsp; that fat ass and his Harper crew is doing about the stone. I want eyes on them."</i></span><br><br><span class="text-small"><i><strong><u>Davil</u>:</strong> "Yes madame."</i></span><br><br><span class="text-small"><i><strong><u>Yalah</u>:</strong> "Orond, darling, please get me my purse I need to supply Davil with money for the mole."</i></span><br><span class="text-small"><i>Orond left along with Hrabbaz.</i></span><br><br><span class="text-small"><i><strong><u>Yalah</u>:</strong> "One more thing Davil, keep an eye on that goblin Ultrævil boy. You know the Ultrævils, correct? Those ridiculous excuses for nobles here in the North Ward. You see, one of them, the goblin boy, threatened me. I need you to dig up some dirt on them. Find out what they're here for. If they happen to be going for the stone as well, I want you to eliminate them. Ugh, no you can't possibly, if you can't,&nbsp; have Urstul pay them a visit, that should be fun."</i></span><br><br><span class="text-small"><strong><u>Orond: </u></strong><i>returns.</i></span><br><br><span class="text-small"><i><strong><u>Yalah:</u></strong> "And here's your money, Davil. Go." Davil paces towards the carriage house.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</i></span>At this point Flinch was nervous and hopped off Shrike. He told his family to disperse, as Davil was about to go out via the carriage house. They did that, hiding in the shadows or simply pretending to be bystanders. When Davil's carriage was nowhere to be seen, Raven used owlbert to further snoop at the Gralhunds:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="text-small"><i><strong><u>Yalah:</u></strong> "Orond, have the&nbsp;thing find the stone as well. These thugs are slow as slimes. My gut feeling tells me Dalakhar must have the stone by now. Give&nbsp;it&nbsp;the necklace as well. Okay?" She'll kiss Orond on the forehead.</i></span><br><br><span class="text-small"><i><strong><u>Orond:</u></strong> "Don't worry dear, you'll have the money soon enough."</i></span><br><br><span class="text-small"><i><strong><u>Yalah:</u></strong> "I know I will, one of these days I'll be a masked lord as well. Just you wait."&nbsp;</i></span><br><br><span class="text-small"><i>She chuckles and they go inside the main house.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</i></span>Shocked and confused at the info they just learned, the Ultrævils&nbsp;to call it a day and go home. The carriage ride home left them pondering at the meaning of what Yalah said, and rightfully so, because it seemed that she was adamant in sending Urstul after them because of what happened back at the Lightsinger.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They made a quick stop at the Lightsinger before going home. Birdflu reported his findings, and also managed to get another stack of paper birds from the Harpers. There were 7 in total. Eventually, they arrived back at the manor, their sleep only slightly perturbed by the sound of rats.</p>
<h2>The Climb</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By this time, construction of Trollskull manor was 4 days in. Shrike had used one of Birdflu's paper birds to join Force Grey, and Flinch has just received his first quest. The family eventually decided to pursue Force Grey's first task: finding Hlam the monk on Mount Waterdeep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Going to Mount Waterdeep was easy enough, but climbing it proved too tiring for some members of the family, notably Birdflu and Robin, who barely made it to Hlam's area in the mountain. Aside from the harrowing climb, the task was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon talking to Hlam and asking him about any threats to the city, he replied with:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Evil's twin hides its face for now. Expect that to change before winter's end."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hlam's cryptic message was immediately relayed back to Vajra, and Shrike was rewarded.</p>
<h2>The Farmland's Plight</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Climbing to Mount Waterdeep was difficult, but it took only the whole morning to scale it. With Birdflu and Robin resting in the carriage, the Ultrævils proceeded to the Emerald Enclave's first task given to Raven. They had to eliminate scarecrows in the farmlands of Waterdeep. Several farmers were already displaced at this time, and it is hurting both the city's supply of food, and the farmer's livelihood.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;got there in the late afternoon, they gathered all scarecrows who had any bit of magical tint to them into one spot and set the aflame. This triggered the scarecrows to come alive, but the Ultrævils&nbsp;dispatched them easily. The farmers gave Raven an extra for the help on top of the Enclave's reward. The day was finished, and the Ultrævils&nbsp;finally rested.</p>
<h2>Dungsweepers and the Cat Lady</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Lord's Alliance gave Flinch his first task, which was admittedly sort of dull. Flinch's first task was to last a tenday, and it involved watching over the Dungsweeper Guild at the Trades Ward as gang wars killed off a few of their members. Flinch immediately went there, and sat watch over the Dungsweepers.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, Birdflu and the rest (excluding Robin, who opted to rest) went on the Harper's next task, which involved helping out an old woman by the name of Uza Solizeph. The woman asked for help as she had trapped a monstrous floating ball with eyes in her shop. The group met up with her in one of the inns close to her house.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dealing with the "monster she described was quite easy, as the Ultrævils had dealt with one before. The monster was a gazer, and it took only a few seconds to kill this specimen in Uza's shop. The day drew to a close, and the Ultrævils&nbsp;all went home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RIght before the hit the hay, John Doe knocked on the door to inform the Ultrævils&nbsp;of his new wares. Which included one musket, one pistol, and some ammunition. Flinch also paid a visit to Vincent Trench, who informed him of Emmek Frewn's affiliation with the Shard Runners, a gang of wererats. Flinch gave him gold for more information, this time on Yalah Gralhund.</p>
