<h2>Opposite Invitations</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was early evening at the Yawning Portal, and Birdflu has his eyes set on Yagra eating a sandwich by the well to Undermountain. He and his family had been tracking down the whereabouts of two Zhent agents, and they've found one of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The other members of the family started ordering some food while asking Bonnie some questions about the other Zhent agent, Davil Starsong. Bonnie told Flinch, Shrike, and Raven that Davil stayed at one of the rooms in the Yawning Portal, but hasn't been here today. She also mentioned that Davil and Yagra always meet here every night. Bonnie went back to the kitchen after taking their orders and answering a few questions. After a while, Yagra finished her sandwich and started walking to the bar. Birdflu followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bright lights in the Yawning Portal did not help Birdflu much with staying discreet, neither did his royal blue Harper cape. Yagra didn't notice him, but one person from the crowd did: Jalester Silvermane. Jalester approached Birdflu with the intent of inviting him to join the Lord's Alliance, failing to notice Birdflu's Harper Pin. He was immediately turned down by Birdflu, who was quite annoyed that he was getting bothered while observing Yagra. He referred his other family members to Jalester.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, Bonnie returned to the Ultrævils' table with their orders and was immediately questioned once more by Flinch who was inquiring about Davil's likely whereabouts. Bonnie simple replied that she doesn't know, but they may ask someone who does. Before the Ultrævils could react, Bonnie called out for Yagra who seated by the bar. Everyone at the table was surprised at the sudden callout; Yagra approached the table.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bonnie explained to Yagra that the Ultrævils&nbsp;were looking for Davil. Yagra eyed them suspiciously, but decided that they didn't look threatening. She asked the seated adventurers why they were looking for Davil, to which they replied that one of them was interested in joining the Zhents. Yagra was surprised and started to talk in a hushed voice. She told the characters that Davil isn't available right now because he was preoccupied at the Gralhund villa for matters she didn't want to discuss. She told the players to wait here at the Yawning Portal. Although new recruits normally visit the Gralhund villa anyway, Yagra instructed them to wait here instead.</p>
