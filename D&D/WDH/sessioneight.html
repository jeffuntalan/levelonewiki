<h2>Blade in the Dark</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Birdflu sits on his chair resting from the fatigue brought by the previous day when he heard some activity outside of his window. Being on the third floor, sounds of scuffling are quite rare, and tonight was an exception. Birdflu awoke to find hooded figure prying open his window, a knife clenched between his teeth. The window opened easily and as the thief prepared to climb down the windowsill and into the room, Birdlfu asked what the person was doing there. The person did not respond, and Birdflu cast <i><strong>Heat Metal </strong></i>on the knife causing the assassin's lips to burn. The assassin tried to attack Birdflu but owing to the cramped space in the room, it missed and Birdflu was able to push it out the window. Birdflu fell with the assassin, but managed to land on his feet, further bludgeoning the assassin below. The bruised assassin escaped and disappeared into the night, leaving Birdflu along in the quiet streets of Trollskull Alley once more.</p>
<h2>Explosion in the Alley</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next morning, Birdflu recounted the events of the previous night to his family with mirth. During this conversation, Shrike received a message from Vajra while Birdflu received a paper bird from Mirt. Vajra message was:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A young bronze dragon has taken up residence in Deepwater Harbor. It startled a few sailors recently but hasn't hurt anyone. Confront the dragon and learn its intentions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Mirt's note had the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"One of our members, Mattrim Mereg, has allied himself with a gang of doppelgangers and believes the Harpers should recruit them. We need an unbiased opinion. Track down and speak with each of the doppelgangers, and gauge their trustworthiness."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only two arrived that morning. While the rest of the Ultrævils pondered on which of the two tasks to do first and Flinch was rushing breakfast in order to go to work at the Dock Ward, a knock resounded on Trollskull Manor's front door. It was none other than Renaer Neverember.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Renaer's reason for visiting was because of a message he received recently. Dalakhar, his father's rock gnome confidante, was asking for the Ultrævils' address in Waterdeep from Renaer. Hesitant to give personal info right away, he made it sure to ask the Ultrævils in person. Unable to pinpoint the exact reason why, the Ultrævils with Renaer decided to meet with Dalakhar at the Yawning Portal by naming their terms on a paper bird addressed to him. It was nearly 8AM at this point, and Flinch decided to take the family's riding horse and make a break for it to the Dock Ward. As Flinch rode through the alley, a <strong>deafening explosion</strong> startled the area, the center of which was the southern end of John Doe's textile shop. A shockwave could be felt in the perimeter, shattering the glass of the nearby greenhouse of Corellon's Crown as well as the windows of nearby establishments -- Trollskull Manor included.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A crowd slowly began to form around the scene, and the sounds of Trollskull alley went from the dead silence of shock to a few cries of grief and disbelief. The other members of the Ultrævils went outside with Renaer, where they saw the aftermath of the explosion.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Raven let out Owlbert to scout the area, while the rest went on asking a few of the locals around the scene. One of the people they asked was <strong>Jezrynne Hornraven</strong> who was just coming out of the Tiger's Eye. When asked what she saw, she told the following tale:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I tell you, it was not a man. More like a puppet shaped like a man. A puppet without strings. It was on the rooftop. It hurled something into the crowd below that caused the explosion. I saw those halflings burned alive! I saw them!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the cries in the alley was coming from a halfling boy named <strong>Martem Trec </strong>who had just experienced the unluckiest experienced of seeing his friends die. He was shushed by Birdflu and questioned by Shrike on what he saw, to which he gave the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Right after the explosion, I ducked behind a rain barrel. Then I heard a 'plop' and found this in the barrel."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Martem showed the Ultrævils&nbsp;what he found, and it was a necklace with a broken clasp containing two feiry-orange beads. Birdflu took it from the boy in exchange for a little bit of money, wondering what it was. Flinch was surveying the aftermath of the explosion, counting off the dead (11 in total) and looking for anything familiar. Flinch found a bag of gems on one of the dead. It was a gnome but its features was too charred to make out. Many eyewitnesses saw Flinch take the bag and look at its contents, all with a look of disapproval. Flinch handed the bag over to Robin, and made his way to the Dock Ward, stating that he will be late for work. Flinch shrugged off the images of the bodies and rode with haste.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After a few moments, a flying griffon circle over the scene and alerted the residents that the Watchers are on the way as well as some of the City Guard. They were advised to touch nothing in the scene. Clerics were the first to arrive in the scene, casting gentle repose on each of the dead bodies. A few moments later, a City Watch sergeant named<strong> Saeth Cromley</strong> escorts a member of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors named <strong>Barnibus Blastwind</strong> to the crime scene. Saeth began taking testimonies from some of the residents while Barnibus orchestrates the other veterans and guards who are now securing the scene and knocking on doors around the area. The Ultrævils&nbsp;were questioned as well, but were least suspected. A minor infraction was noted, however, as some of the locals reported that a member of the Ultrævil family, Flinch to be exact, looted a pouch rom on of the corpses. Right now the pouch was in Raven's possession, and contained expensive gems. Saeth took the pouch from the Ultrævils, citing that it could cost them punishment to do such an act. Birdflu also offered another piece of evidence, the necklace Martem gave him. Saeth took this as well and let the incident slip. The investigation ensued, and the Ultrævils&nbsp;went back to the manor with Renaer.</p>
