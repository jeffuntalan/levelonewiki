<h2>Blade in the Dark</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Birdflu sits on his chair resting from the fatigue brought by the previous day when he heard some activity outside of his window. Being on the third floor, sounds of scuffling are quite rare, and tonight was an exception. Birdflu awoke to find hooded figure prying open his window, a knife clenched between his teeth. The window opened easily and as the thief prepared to climb down the windowsill and into the room, Birdlfu asked what the person was doing there. The person did not respond, and Birdflu cast <i><strong>Heat Metal </strong></i>on the knife causing the assassin's lips to burn. The assassin tried to attack Birdflu but owing to the cramped space in the room, it missed and Birdflu was able to push it out the window. Birdflu fell with the assassin, but managed to land on his feet, further bludgeoning the assassin below. The bruised assassin escaped and disappeared into the night, leaving Birdflu along in the quiet streets of Trollskull Alley once more.</p>
<h2>Explosion in the Alley</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next morning, Birdflu recounted the events of the previous night to his family with mirth. During this conversation, Shrike received a message from Vajra while Birdflu received a paper bird from Mirt. Vajra message was:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A young bronze dragon has taken up residence in Deepwater Harbor. It startled a few sailors recently but hasn't hurt anyone. Confront the dragon and learn its intentions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Mirt's note had the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"One of our members, Mattrim Mereg, has allied himself with a gang of doppelgangers and believes the Harpers should recruit them. We need an unbiased opinion. Track down and speak with each of the doppelgangers, and gauge their trustworthiness."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only two arrived that morning. While the rest of the Ultrævils pondered on which of the two tasks to do first and Flinch was rushing breakfast in order to go to work at the Dock Ward, a knock resounded on Trollskull Manor's front door. It was none other than Renaer Neverember.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Renaer's reason for visiting was because of a message he received recently. Dalakhar, his father's rock gnome confidante, was asking for the Ultrævils' address in Waterdeep from Renaer. Hesitant to give personal info right away, he made it sure to ask the Ultrævils in person. Unable to pinpoint the exact reason why, the Ultrævils with Renaer decided to meet with Dalakhar at the Yawning Portal by naming their terms on a paper bird addressed to him. It was nearly 8AM at this point, and Flinch decided to take the family's riding horse and make a break for it to the Dock Ward. As Flinch rode through the alley, a <strong>deafening explosion</strong> startled the area, the center of which was the southern end of John Doe's textile shop. A shockwave could be felt in the perimeter, shattering the glass of the nearby greenhouse of Corellon's Crown as well as the windows of nearby establishments -- Trollskull Manor included.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A crowd slowly began to form around the scene, and the sounds of Trollskull alley went from the dead silence of shock to a few cries of grief and disbelief. The other members of the Ultrævils went outside with Renaer, where they saw the aftermath of the explosion.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Raven let out Owlbert to scout the area, while the rest went on asking a few of the locals around the scene. One of the people they asked was <strong>Jezrynne Hornraven</strong> who was just coming out of the Tiger's Eye. When asked what she saw, she told the following tale:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I tell you, it was not a man. More like a puppet shaped like a man. A puppet without strings. It was on the rooftop. It hurled something into the crowd below that caused the explosion. I saw those halflings burned alive! I saw them!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the cries in the alley was coming from a halfling boy named <strong>Martem Trec </strong>who had just experienced the unluckiest experienced of seeing his friends die. He was shushed by Birdflu and questioned by Shrike on what he saw, to which he gave the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Right after the explosion, I ducked behind a rain barrel. Then I heard a 'plop' and found this in the barrel."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Martem showed the Ultrævils&nbsp;what he found, and it was a necklace with a broken clasp containing two feiry-orange beads. Birdflu took it from the boy in exchange for a little bit of money, wondering what it was. Flinch was surveying the aftermath of the explosion, counting off the dead (11 in total) and looking for anything familiar. Flinch found a bag of gems on one of the dead. It was a gnome but its features was too charred to make out. Many eyewitnesses saw Flinch take the bag and look at its contents, all with a look of disapproval. Flinch handed the bag over to Robin, and made his way to the Dock Ward, stating that he will be late for work. Flinch shrugged off the images of the bodies and rode with haste. Meanwhile, Owlbert noticed a limping figure inching its way past the alley and in the direction of the Book Wyrm's Treasure.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After a few moments, a flying griffon circle over the scene and alerted the residents that the Watchers are on the way as well as some of the City Guard. They were advised to touch nothing in the scene. Clerics were the first to arrive in the scene, casting gentle repose on each of the dead bodies. A few moments later, a City Watch sergeant named<strong> Saeth Cromley</strong> escorts a member of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors named <strong>Barnibus Blastwind</strong> to the crime scene. Saeth began taking testimonies from some of the residents while Barnibus orchestrates the other veterans and guards who are now securing the scene and knocking on doors around the area. The Ultrævils&nbsp;were questioned as well, but were least suspected. A minor infraction was noted, however, as some of the locals reported that a member of the Ultrævil family, Flinch to be exact, looted a pouch rom on of the corpses. Right now the pouch was in Raven's possession, and contained expensive gems. Saeth took the pouch from the Ultrævils, citing that it could cost them punishment to do such an act. Birdflu also offered another piece of evidence, the necklace Martem gave him. Saeth took this as well and let the incident slip. The investigation ensued, and the Ultrævils&nbsp;went back to the manor with Renaer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;discussed the matter of Dalakhar back at the manor. They eventually recalled that Dalakhar was involved with an artifact called the “<strong>Stone of Golorr</strong>” which was mentioned by Remallia Haventree and the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Laeral Silverhand back at the Lightsinger Theater. The Ultrævils&nbsp;figured that the stone may be linked to the rumored cache of gold that the factions are seeking around Waterdeep.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The current plan was to send Dalakhar a paper bird containing the details of where to meet and maybe follow it. After pondering, they let out the paper bird. Outside, it seems like the investigation was still ongoing but the bodies were removed from the scene. A carriage containing the dead bodies made it's way past the manor, going north to the High Road. Raven, through the eyes of Owlbert, noticed that the paper bird they addressed to Dalakhar landed on top of the carriage carrying the dead bodies.</p>
<h2>Connecting the Dots</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After realizing that they might the pouch of valuable gems might have been Dalakhar's (who was unfortunately caught in the explosion), the Ultrævils&nbsp;took their carriage and rode swiftly towards the Watch's headquarters close to the Heroes' Garden in the Sea Ward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Travelling at breakneck speed, they managed to arrive at the headquarters and ask for Saeth. Raven put up an act of accidentally “giving Saeth the wrong pouch” on the front desk attendant and successfully persuaded him to call for Saeth. Saeth was hesitant to face them at first and believe the story, but Birdflu's silver tongue proved effective at backing up Raven's story. Saeth asked them to wait by his desk while he fetched the pouch from the evidence room. On Saeth's table was the notebook that he carried during the investigation. The Ultrævils&nbsp;skimmed the pages of the notebook and learned of another testimony that they had not taken. It was none other than their neighbor, Fala Lefaliir's testimony:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I was watering plants in the greenhouse on the second floor of my shop when the blast blew out some of the windows. Lucky I wasn't injured! Through the smoke, I saw a cloaked man take something from the body of a dead gnome, then start limping away. He was badly burned and casting glances over his shoulder, like he was afraid someone might be following him. He was headed toward the Book Wyrm's Treasure."</p>
</blockquote>

</figure>
<p>The pouch had only gems in it! Based on Fala's testimony, a mysterious figure took something from Dalakhar's corpse and escaped. Raven felt bad on making Saeth look for “her pouch" in the evidence room after the realization. Saeth showed up a few moments later with the said pouch, and traded it for the one in Raven's possession. He bid the Ultrævils&nbsp;a good day, and accompanied them to their carriage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;were back to Trollskull Alley, this time keen on investigating the Book Wyrm's Treasure. They travelled quickly still, and managed to get hold of Rishaal, a bronze dragonborn who manages the establishment. Upon questioning, he was quite truthful in saying that he had noticed a man who had noticeable injuries as well as a charred quality to his clothing pass by the front of the shop, his boots making tiny ash marks on the pavement. This was all the info he knew, aside from adding that the man suddenly vanished into thin air when he noticed Rishaal looking at him. With this information, the Ultrævils&nbsp;tracked down the tiny ash marks with a bit of difficulty, but just enough to lead them into a very familiar place.</p>
<h2>Turmoil at the Villa</h2>

  <figcaption>Bodies lay scattered in the dining area of the Gralhund Villa</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The tracks led them to none other than the Gralhund Villa. The villa was earily quiet at near the coach house, which was previously occupied by Zhent agents. Upon closer inspection with Owlbert's help, there was only one man outside the Villa in the courtyard, accompanied by two mastiffs. Robin noticed an open door that led to the pantry of the villa, but was unfortunately locked. This was picked with relative ease by Robin, who immediately saw a gruesome scene within. Two dead bodies were slumped at the floor of the pantry, throats slit and blood pooling on the floor. The Ultrævils&nbsp;passed by the room stealthily, and peered into the western door. The next room was a large dining area, which contained two guards as well as multiple bodies scattered around them. The guards were discussing if they should help upstairs, or to just heed instruction and keep watch on the room. They had Zhent tattoos on the napes.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Owlbert went from outside the villa and onto the chimney, which led to the same dining area. Upon emerging in a cloud of ash, Owlbert's entrance served as the signal for a barrage of attacks prepared by the Ultrævils&nbsp;who were lying in wait near the pantry door. The Ultrævils&nbsp;made short work of the two thugs, and as they neared the stairs to the second floor, they could hear the loud commotion of a battle upstairs.</p>
