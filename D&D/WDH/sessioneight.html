<h2>Blade in the Dark</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Birdflu sits on his chair resting from the fatigue brought by the previous day when he heard some activity outside of his window. Being on the third floor, sounds of scuffling are quite rare, and tonight was an exception. Birdflu awoke to find hooded figure prying open his window, a knife clenched between his teeth. The window opened easily and as the thief prepared to climb down the windowsill and into the room, Birdlfu asked what the person was doing there. The person did not respond, and Birdflu cast <i><strong>Heat Metal </strong></i>on the knife causing the assassin's lips to burn. The assassin tried to attack Birdflu but owing to the cramped space in the room, it missed and Birdflu was able to push it out the window. Birdflu fell with the assassin, but managed to land on his feet, further bludgeoning the assassin below. The bruised assassin escaped and disappeared into the night, leaving Birdflu along in the quiet streets of Trollskull Alley once more.</p>
<h2>Explosion in the Alley</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next morning, Birdflu recounted the events of the previous night to his family with mirth. During this conversation, Shrike received a message from Vajra while Birdflu received a paper bird from Mirt. Vajra message was:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A young bronze dragon has taken up residence in Deepwater Harbor. It startled a few sailors recently but hasn't hurt anyone. Confront the dragon and learn its intentions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Mirt's note had the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"One of our members, Mattrim Mereg, has allied himself with a gang of doppelgangers and believes the Harpers should recruit them. We need an unbiased opinion. Track down and speak with each of the doppelgangers, and gauge their trustworthiness."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only two arrived that morning. The rest of the Ultrævils pondered on which of the two tasks to do first, while Flinch was rushing breakfast in order to go to work at the Dock Ward</p>
