<h2>Blade in the Dark</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Birdflu sits on his chair resting from the fatigue brought by the previous day when he heard some activity outside of his window. Being on the third floor, sounds of scuffling are quite rare, and tonight was an exception. Birdflu awoke to find hooded figure prying open his window, a knife clenched between his teeth. The window opened easily and as the thief prepared to climb down the windowsill and into the room, Birdlfu asked what the person was doing there. The person did not respond, and Birdflu cast <i><strong>Heat Metal </strong></i>on the knife causing the assassin's lips to burn. The assassin tried to attack Birdflu but owing to the cramped space in the room, it missed and Birdflu was able to push it out the window. Birdflu fell with the assassin, but managed to land on his feet, further bludgeoning the assassin below. The bruised assassin escaped and disappeared into the night, leaving Birdflu along in the quiet streets of Trollskull Alley once more.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Only two arrived that morning. While the rest of the Ultrævils pondered on which of the two tasks to do first and Flinch was rushing breakfast in order to go to work at the Dock Ward, a knock resounded on Trollskull Manor's front door. It was none other than Renaer Neverember.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Renaer's reason for visiting was because of a message he received recently. Dalakhar, his father's rock gnome confidante, was asking for the Ultrævils' address in Waterdeep from Renaer. Hesitant to give personal info right away, he made it sure to ask the Ultrævils in person. Unable to pinpoint the exact reason why, the Ultrævils with Renaer decided to meet with Dalakhar at the Yawning Portal by naming their terms on a paper bird addressed to him. It was nearly 8AM at this point, and Flinch decided to take the family's riding horse and make a break for it to the Dock Ward. As Flinch rode through the alley, he was&nbsp;</p>
