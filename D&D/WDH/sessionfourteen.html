<h2>Bargain after bargain</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At around 10PM, the second floor of the Nottelere Tavern was a crowded place. The family accompanied by Jarlaxle, was surrounding the bound Ammalia and Victoro Cassalanter. Victoro was spotted lurking outside the Nottelere, and when confronted by Shrike and Flinch, tried to dominate them. This triggered hostility from the two, which led Shrike to grapple Victoro, who did nothing else. Ammalia, soon surrendered as well, seeing his husband already captured.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jarlaxle introduced himself as an Illuskan Drow noble who has come to Waterdeep in the guise of a Illuskan Human. After making a name for himself as a celebrity, he furthered his intentions of gaining the favor of Laeral Silverhand, who he thinks may be able to help him with the situation at Luskan. He intends to obtain the stolen cache of dragons in the name of Waterdeep, in order to convince Laeral to help him. The family has their suspicions of Jarlaxle, but were convinced that Jarlaxle was telling the truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand, the Cassalanter couple detailed their intentions further. They admitted that as a young couple, they enjoyed their share of greed––both in money, and power. They coveted these two things so much which led them to bargain with Asmodeus, the prince of demons. They got what they wanted, power, and money, but the consequences of their decisions would come back and haunt them, as Asmodeus wanted the souls of their children. At first this did not seem too bad of a deal, being the greedy, selfish, foolish individuals they were. Over time, however, as their lives prospered, they started to appreciate other aspects of life. Their first born had already been taken, and they found that to be harder than they anticipated; now that their twin daughters were almost 9 years old, they fear that Asmodeus would reap their souls as well. They pleaded with the demon, who detailed that in order to spare the souls of their two daughters, they must repay the wealth that was given to them. One million dragons was asked, but at that time, they did not have that sum.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the Cassalanters told their tale, the family was both shocked and amused at the foolishness of the couple.</p>
