<h2>Bargain after bargain</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At around 10PM, the second floor of the Nottelere Tavern was a crowded place. The family accompanied by Jarlaxle, was surrounding the bound Ammalia and Victoro Cassalanter. Victoro was spotted lurking outside the Nottelere, and when confronted by Shrike and Flinch, tried to dominate them. This triggered hostility from the two, which led Shrike to grapple Victoro, who did nothing else. Ammalia, soon surrendered as well, seeing his husband already captured.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jarlaxle introduced himself as an Illuskan Drow noble who has come to Waterdeep in the guise of a Illuskan Human. After making a name for himself as a celebrity, he furthered his intentions of gaining the favor of Laeral Silverhand, who he thinks may be able to help him with the situation at Luskan. He intends to obtain the stolen cache of dragons in the name of Waterdeep, in order to convince Laeral to help him. The family has their suspicions of Jarlaxle, but were convinced that Jarlaxle was telling the truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand, the Cassalanter couple detailed their intentions further. They admitted that as a young couple, they enjoyed their share of greed––both in money, and power. They coveted these two things so much which led them to bargain with Asmodeus, the prince of demons. They got what they wanted, power, and money, but the consequences of their decisions would come back and haunt them, as Asmodeus wanted the souls of their children. At first this did not seem too bad of a deal, being the greedy, selfish, foolish individuals they were. Over time, however, as their lives prospered, they started to appreciate other aspects of life. Their first born had already been taken, and they found that to be harder than they anticipated; now that their twin daughters were almost 9 years old, they fear that Asmodeus would reap their souls as well. They pleaded with the demon, who detailed that in order to spare the souls of their two daughters, they must repay the wealth that was given to them. One million dragons was asked, but at that time, they did not have that sum.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the Cassalanters told their tale, the family was both shocked and amused at the foolishness of the couple. It was Jarlaxle who broke the ice and offered to put in a good word for the family. He assured them that they could be given funding, be promoted in their respective factions, and even land them vast renown in Waterdeep. The Cassalanters instead, told the characters that should they help in saving the lives of their two daughters, they promise to be patrons of the family, and would also allow them to choose magic items &nbsp;from their collection, in order to help them with their quest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The family decided rather swiftly; they turned down Jarlaxle and sent him on his way. Flinch subtly cast detect magic before he left, noting that Jarlaxle carried a small trove of magic items on his person. The Cassalanters thought that they too would be declined, as the family expressed their intentions of being an independent “mafia” in Waterdeep. The Cassalanter couple were muttering what appears to be words of a spell, when the family interjected, expressing interest in their offer, with a few slight modifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The family revised the contract to state that they would allow the Cassalanters to use the cache of dragons to save the lives of their children, but they have to repay it with 20% interest. In return, the family would help the Cassalanters deal with finding the cache. The children would also be under the care of the family, up until the bargain has been fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The contract was signed in blood, and without wasting any time, the Cassalanters invited the family over to collect their chosen item from their collection.</p>
<h2>A Sappy Encounter</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Cassalanter Villa was a luxurious one, but not enough time was available for the family to explore it. They were led to a room lined by shelves of various objects, almost like an antique shop. Flinch chose a <i>bag of holding</i>, Robin chose a pair of <i>goggles of night</i>, Birdflu chose a <i>chime of opening</i>, Igor chose a pair of <i>bracers of defense,</i> and Shrike chose an <i>immovable rod</i>. Raven and Aric have yet to reveal what they chose, as they stayed behind to handle the rest of the guests in Nottelere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Raven has been having problems with the stone recently. It worked for her for a day, but it suddenly deemed her unworthy. The stone expressed its longing to be in possession of someone else, but with the help of Victoro, Raven managed to speak with the stone again. Asking for the location of the cache with the help of Victoro revealed that the treasure is hidden in the City of the Dead, underneath one of the mausoleums. The Cassalanters and the family headed there immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the City of the Dead, Raven and Victoro continued consulting the stone on the location of the cache, and it led them to a mausoleum of a family named <strong>Brandath</strong>. The family knew no one of the Brandath family, but Victoro did, as Dagult Neverember married into the family. Birdflu then remembered Renaer, the son of the exiled former Open Lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The mausoleum was one of the grander ones in the cemetery, with trees flanking both sides as well as the back of the large marble structure. Pillars were arranged in threes in front of the structure, the middle of which was the door. Robin immediately started picking the lock.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Robin picked, the ground started rumbling, and before long the western tree stood up and attacked the family. Two other treants stood up from beside the mausoleum. Battle ensued, but with the help of Ammalia's flame spells, Shrike's immovable rod, and rest of the family's attacks, the treants proved no match.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin managed to finally pick the lock undisturbed. Flinch detected a glyph on the last step of the stairs entering the crypt, and made this known to everyone. At this time, the family and the Cassalanters opted to rest first before delving further. They also wanted to let Renaer know that they'll be entering their family crypt. The Cassalanters agreed to meet the players early morning the next day, and bid goodbye. Orpheus stayed behind to keep watch, and Flinch firmly stated that he should not step on the glyph.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The family travelled back to Nottelere, where a drunk Renaer was gathered with Floon and Volo. The family isolated him from the others, and told him what happened. He was a bit surprised at what he heard, but he expressed that he would help the family. He also said that they might need a place to crash for the night, as Floon and Volo were a bit wasted. This was of no issue to the family, who agreed.</p>
<h2>Unconventional Keys</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The family and the Cassalanters met up at the city of the dead before sunrise the next day, a day before the family's court hearing against Yalah. Renaer noticed the burnt oak trees that his mother cared for, to which the family explained, the trees attacked first.</p>
