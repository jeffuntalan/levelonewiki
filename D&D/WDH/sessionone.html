<h2>We start in a tavern…</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Winters in waterdeep are harsh and will often put large portions of the city to a halt, but for newcomers like the Ultrævil family, the dip in activity still seems like an awful lot of it. The Yawning Portal is a testament to this. As the Ultrævils take their place amongst the crowd, they are greeted by familiar faces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meloon Wardragon for one, immediately recognizes a former member of Force Gray: Shrike Catbird Ultrævil, and his former intern, Peregrine Flinch Ultrævil. More familiar faces recognize the newly-settled members of the family. Bonnie the barkeep greets and takes the order of Birdflu Morepork Ultrævil, after a waiter got spooked of his goblin ancestry. Threestrings the bard was also here, who performed a new song about Waterdeep in among the patrons of the Yawning Portal (they weren't too keen about the song).&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Threestring's Ballad of Waterdeep</strong></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Before history was written</p>
          <p>There was a mountain great and tall</p>
          <p>By the name of Waterdeep &nbsp;</p>
          <p>It cradles new life by the shore</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>To the elves it’s Aelinthaldaar &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The seat of an empire old</p>
          <p>To the dwarves it’s home to mithril</p>
          <p>Buried deep for fortune’s sold</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Elves and dwarves they came together</p>
          <p>Till the magic tore them twixt</p>
          <p>So the human’s found the city</p>
          <p>It was empty and it… was… &nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>For a thousand years they traded</p>
          <p>Whilst the wizard’s tower grew</p>
          <p>Halistar Blackcloak his name was</p>
          <p>Then he vanished out of the blue</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Many warlords rose and fell</p>
          <p>Those it’s Neimor’s memory we keep &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
          <p>For he named the town of Neimor’s hold</p>
          <p>The town of Water’s Deep</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Waterdeep, Waterdeep</p>
          <p>The proudest port of all</p>
          <p>The melting pot of the northern lands</p>
          <p>The greatest city sprawl</p>
          <p>…</p>

        <td style="text-align:center;">
          <p>…</p>
          <p>As the elves and dwarves fought on</p>
          <p>So the trolls they fled down here</p>
          <p>As poor Neimor breathed his last breath</p>
          <p>Oh the future seems unclear</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>But the youth Ahghairon rose</p>
          <p>Used his magic far and wide</p>
          <p>Lived a long old life protecting us</p>
          <p>from dangers most belied</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Through betrayal and hardship strong</p>
          <p>Oh Ahghairon did survive</p>
          <p>And from flaming throne he laid the law</p>
          <p>To which we all abide</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>He would be the first of many</p>
          <p>Oh the open lord on high</p>
          <p>But oh wise Ahghairon knew</p>
          <p>That too much power goes awry</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>So a council he did summon</p>
          <p>Gave to each a mask to keep</p>
          <p>So no bribe or blackmail’d find them</p>
          <p>Oh the masked lord of Waterdeep</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Waterdeep, Waterdeep</p>
          <p>The proudest port of all</p>
          <p>The melting pot of the northern lands</p>
          <p>The greatest city sprawl</p>
