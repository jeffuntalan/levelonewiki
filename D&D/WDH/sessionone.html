<h2>We Start in a Tavern…</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Winters in waterdeep are harsh and will often put large portions of the city to a halt, but for newcomers like the Ultrævil family, the dip in activity still seems like an awful lot of it. The Yawning Portal is a testament to this. As the Ultrævils take their place amongst the crowd, they are greeted by familiar faces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meloon Wardragon for one, immediately recognizes a former member of Force Gray: Shrike Catbird Ultrævil, and his former intern, Peregrine Flinch Ultrævil. More familiar faces recognize the newly-settled members of the family. Bonnie the barkeep greets and takes the order of Birdflu Morepork Ultrævil, after a waiter got spooked of his goblin ancestry. Threestrings the bard was also here, who performed a new song about Waterdeep in among the patrons of the Yawning Portal (they weren't too keen about the song).&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tavern Brawl</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The eating, drinking, and boo-ing was all interrupted by a shout coming from the edge of the hole to Undermountain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ya pig! Like killin' me mates, does ya?!</i></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yagra Stonefist was grappling a bald man dressed in black while five other men dressed in black are trying to beat the crap out of Yagra and release their compatriot. The Ultrævil family decide to interfere. After a few seconds, Raven Dickcissel Ultrævil managed to entangle all the men dressed in black. Yagra was not affected by the vines, but the short ceasefire was interrupted by loud thuds coming from the hole to Undermountain.</p>
<h2>Troll!</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Troll! </i>Durnan shouts, while getting his sword and crossbow.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The crane by the hole to Undermountain breaks under the weight of the troll that used it to hoist itself up. Adventurers on the crane platform crash down into the depths below. Two trolls--a large on and a smaller one--manage to escape Undermountain and are now looking for a meal amongst the patrons of the Yawning Portal. A fight ensues. After an mind-breaking insult by Birdflu, hits were given out by Dickcissel and Peregrine. Chase steps back and watches from the back. Shrike tries to grapple the larger troll but fails. In the end, Yagra manages to push the troll back into the depths.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The smaller troll hits Shrike and injures him badly. Hits from Durnan and the others land on the Troll, and Shrike manages to grapple it. Another push from Yagra finishes it off. Shrike gets healed by another friend of his, Obaya Uday, who took notice of his wounds. Chase drops a platter of food down the hole to <i>give the trolls food.</i></p>

<h2>A Friend in Need</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Durnan slashes the bill of the Ultrævil family after their display of courage. Little does the family know that another patron of the Yawning Portal was watching. It was no other than the renowned explorer, writer, and local celebrity, Volothamp “Volo” Geddarm. Volo combs through tables and the crowd and strikes up a conversation with the Ultrævil family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After initial pleasantries, Volo seems to be in need of help. A good friend of his, Floon Blagmaar, has been missing for a couple of days now. He offered the Ultrævils 10 gold pieces downpayment and 100 more if they find Floon. Volo last seen Floon at The Skewered Dragon tavern at the Dock Ward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After a few more conversations about the Yawning Portal and a few inquiries by Peregrine to Obaya about Volo, the Ultrævils set out to find Floon. Volo goves them money to take a carriage, but they opted to walk instead.</p>

<h2><strong>Blood in the Streets</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A walk down Snail Lane allowed the Ultrævils&nbsp;to see one of the prevalent problems of the City. Right in the intersection of Fish Street and Snail lane was an encounter of two parties resulting in the death of six people. Three watchers were already present in the scene, keeping the road closed and watching over three apprehended individuals. Chase notices the tattoos and the attire of the two involved parties in the incident: they were members of the Xanathar's Guild and the Zhentarim.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;get escorted through Trollskull Alley by Cod, one of the watchers. They proceed down the Way of the Dragon and turn right into Fillet Lane. The Skewered Dragon sign was in sight. However, Birdflu suggested they visit a rather Purple Shop just a few feet from The Skewered Dragon.</p>
