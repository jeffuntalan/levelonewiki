<h2>We Start in a Tavern…</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Winters in Waterdeep are harsh and will often put large portions of the city to a halt, but for newcomers like the Ultrævil family, the dip in activity still seems like an awful lot of it. The Yawning Portal is a testament to this. As the Ultrævils take their place amongst the crowd, they are greeted by familiar faces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Meloon Wardragon</strong> for one, immediately recognizes a former member of Force Gray: <strong>Shrike Catbird Ultrævil</strong>, and his former intern, <strong>Peregrine Flinch Ultrævil</strong>. More familiar faces recognize the newly-settled members of the family. <strong>Bonnie </strong>the barkeep greets and takes the order of <strong>Birdflu Morepork Ultrævil</strong>, after a waiter got spooked of his goblin ancestry. <strong>Threestrings the Bard</strong> was also here, who performed a new song about Waterdeep in among the patrons of the Yawning Portal (they weren't too keen about the <a href="https://youtu.be/M5JSKA7-LNI">song</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tavern Brawl</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The eating, drinking, and boo-ing was all interrupted by a shout coming from the edge of the hole to Undermountain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ya pig! Like killin' me mates, does ya?!</i></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Yagra Stonefist</strong> was grappling a bald man dressed in black while five other men dressed in black are trying to beat the crap out of Yagra and release their compatriot. The Ultrævil family decide to interfere. After a few seconds, <strong>Raven Dickcissel Ultrævil</strong> managed to entangle all the men dressed in black. Yagra was not affected by the vines, but the short ceasefire was interrupted by loud thuds coming from the hole to Undermountain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Troll!</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Troll! </i><strong>Durnan</strong> shouts, while getting his sword and crossbow.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The crane by the hole to Undermountain breaks under the weight of the troll that used it to hoist itself up. Adventurers on the crane platform crash down into the depths below. Two trolls--a large on and a smaller one--manage to escape Undermountain and are now looking for a meal amongst the patrons of the Yawning Portal. A fight ensues. After an <i>mind-breaking</i> insult by Birdflu, hits were given out by Dickcissel and Peregrine. Chase steps back and watches from the back. Shrike tries to grapple the larger troll but fails. In the end, Yagra manages to push the troll back into the depths.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The smaller troll hits Shrike and injures him badly. Hits from Durnan and the others land on the Troll, and Shrike manages to grapple it. Another push from Yagra finishes it off. Shrike gets healed by another friend of his, <strong>Obaya Uday</strong>, who took notice of his wounds. <strong>Chase Ultrævil</strong> drops a platter of food down the hole to <i>give the trolls food.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Friend in Need</h2>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:52.84%;"><img src="/1st_encounter.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Durnan slashes the bill of the Ultrævil family after their display of courage. Little does the family know that another patron of the Yawning Portal was watching. It was no other than the renowned explorer, writer, and local celebrity, Volothamp “Volo” Geddarm. Volo combs through tables and the crowd and strikes up a conversation with the Ultrævil family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After initial pleasantries, Volo seems to be in need of help. A good friend of his, <strong>Floon Blagmaar</strong>, has been missing for a couple of days now. He offered the Ultrævils 10 gold pieces downpayment and 100 more if they find Floon. Volo last seen Floon at <strong>The Skewered Dragon</strong> tavern at the Dock Ward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After a few more conversations about the Yawning Portal and a few inquiries by Peregrine to Obaya about Volo, the Ultrævils set out to find Floon. Volo goves them money to take a carriage, but they opted to walk instead.</p>
<h2><strong>Blood in the Streets</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A walk down Snail Lane allowed the Ultrævils&nbsp;to see one of the prevalent problems of the City. Right in the intersection of Fish Street and Snail lane was an encounter of two parties resulting in the death of six people. Three watchers were already present in the scene, keeping the road closed and watching over three apprehended individuals. Chase notices the tattoos and the attire of the two involved parties in the incident: they were members of the <i><strong>Xanathar's Guild</strong></i> and the <i><strong>Zhentarim</strong></i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;get escorted through Trollcrook Alley by Cod, one of the watchers. They proceed down the Way of the Dragon and turn right into Fillet Lane. The Skewered Dragon sign was in sight. However, Birdflu suggested they visit a rather Purple Shop just a few feet from The Skewered Dragon.</p>
<h2>Old Xoblob Shop</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/images/wdh/w6moeyv.png">
  <figcaption>Xoblob</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>very</i> purple shop had a logo of what looks like a circle with 10 protruding squiggly lines out of it. Each line had a smaller circle on each end. Inside, heavy purple smoke floats in the air. Every inch of the walls were purple, and the owner himself was purple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chase looked around and started talking in thieves cant, which the owner responded to. Chase asked questions about Floon, and the purple gnome said that he did see someone of that description. He saw Floon with six other men dressed in black, and it seemed like he was being coerced into following them. Another red haired man was with them, being forced in the same way. They struggled, and one of the black-dressed men broke <strong>Old Xoblob Shop</strong>'s window. That was all the gnome knew, but Chase though it was enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Peregrine was looking around when she found a lump of coal that looked like a purple gem but only to her, Birdflu bought half a liter of purple lead dye, and Dickcissel bought a vial of dragon's blood. After the completion of the purchases, they went on their way to The Skewered Dragon.</p>
<h2>The Skewered Dragon</h2>

</figure>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Skewered Dragon was a dimly lit tavern in the Dock Ward. The patrons here were quiet, shady folk, sipping their drinks by the candlelight. Birdflu went in and asked for information from the barkeep right of the bat. However, the barkeep wanted something monetary in exchange for the info. The barkeep was given two gold pieces to loosen his tongue.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Floon did not drink with only Volo that night, the barkeep said. After Volo bid his farewell, Floon met another person at The Skewered Dragon. It was another red-haired individual. After a few rounds of drinking, four men dressed in black showed up, and forced the two to go with them. That's all he knew, the barkeep said. Birdflu managed to persuade the barkeep to reveal who the men were, and he succeeded. They were identified as members of the Zhentarim, and that they will likely be taking them to Candle Lane, where they were frequently seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, a patron of the Skewered was watching the Ultrævils&nbsp;intently from the corner of the room. Peregrine took notice of this. Dickcissel asked the barkeep herself about the identity of the other red-haired individual. The barkeep told her that the price is two gold. Dickcissel was not happy about this, and shelled out only one copper piece. Peregrine saw this, and decided to shell out two gold from her own pocket, and gave it to the barkeep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The other person Floon drank with was none other the <strong>Ranaer Neverember</strong>, the son of the former open lord of Waterdeep, Dagult Neverember. One of the patrons in earshot of their conversation reacted upon hearing the Neverember name. When asked why, the Whaterdhavian responded that the former open lord embezzled a million gold dragons (gold) from the government. He was exiled after that but there were rumors that he hid half a million gold dragons somewhere in Waterdeep, and these rumors circulated. The organizations in Waterdeep started a city-wide treasure hunt after this, which increased crime in the city. The Waterdhavian patron expressed her dislike for the Neverembers clearly because of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Peregrine thanked her for the info and they went out of The Skewered Dragon. One of the patrons followed them out and tailed them for a while, but eventually stopped. They were nearly at Candle Lane.</p>
<h2>Candle Lane</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/images/wdh/candle_lane.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Contrary to its name, Candle Lane was a very dimly-lit street in the Dock Ward. After a few steps in, Chase managed to spot one of the Zhentarim insignias on one of the walls of a building in this street.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chase and Birdflu decided to circle around and see if there were other routes to take. They stealthed around the building.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dickcissel started looking around and tried to check if an open window was available for them to peer into, but the windows of this building was boarded up. The front door was locked as well. However, with exemplary hearing, she managed to discern four voices inside the building. The first voice was a deep voice which said <i>"Xanathar sends its regards." </i>The second voice was a high pitched voice that exclaimed <i>"Tie up the pretty boy in the back room!"</i> and <i>"Follow the yellow signs in the sewers." </i>There was also the barking of the dog, and a fourth voice, that said <i>"No time to loot the place. Just get him to the boss."</i>. Laughter was heard after that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile Chase and Birdlu circled around the building and managed to find a set of double doors leading the the basement. They crossed and fence, and Chase stealthily opened the door. Birdflu peered inside. To his shock, four dead bodies were visible! He immediately stepped back and told Chase, and before long they were going back to their family members by the front of the building. Dickcissel told them what she heard and Birdflu did the same, telling them about the dead bodies. They decided to go to the back doors.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Birdlflu was feeling nauseated from the sight of blood and death inside, and he threw up a little bit. Still, he offered to be the first to go in. The other Ultrævils&nbsp;stayed behind, and Birdflu stealthed successfully. Chase followed, but he slipped on vomit! He managed to regain his balance, but the sound of his scuffling boots was enough to alert the four Kenku that were hiding in the shadows. An encounter was afoot!</p>
