<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The spectral apparition of the Trollskull Manor's former owner, Lif, appeared before the Ultrævils. It seems that despite Volo's failure to spot any ghosts in the manor, it was indeed, haunted. Lif explained that it was someone named Morgana, another former owner of the Trollskull Manor. Lif vanished after their conversation, and the Ultrævils decided to explore the upper floors that night.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The stairs leading to the estate is outside facing the north. When the Ultrævils entered the second floor, the winter wind was just as cold as it was outside, due to the windows that needed repairing. This first room was once the common room of the estate. There were light sources left behind by Volo but they are scattered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flinch decided to check the southern door while the others observed the former estate. There where smiling pictures of the former owner, holding a tankard of ale with some patrons. Some of these pictures hung on the wall, others lie on the floor. The silence of the derelict common room was broken only by the creaking of the southern door that Flinch opened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wave of cold air swept across their faces as the doors revealed a dark hall. Flinch took out his pen from his chest pocket and cast <i>Light</i> on it. The western staircase was illuminated, showing a passage to the third floor. However, <strong>three spectrelings</strong> in the form of children were disturbed by the light! Flinch tried to close the door on them, but the spectrelings traversed through the walls and fought them. Birdflu tried to coax them into nonhostility with an illusion of a ball, but they wen at the Ultrævils nevertheless. Putting out the pen light did nothing to calm them as well. In the end, the spectrelings were defeated; their childlike visage reduced to ectoplasmic goop. The Ultrævils scouted the rest of the floor, finding only rubble, spare bedrooms, and a dilapidated den. The proceeded to the third floor.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the top of the stairs, the Ultrævils&nbsp;notice Lif floating idly in the middle of the third floor landing. There is a staircase here leading to the fourth floor, a hallway to the west, and two doors to the east of the staircase where they were. Flinch opened the northern door under the staircase cautiously, only to find an unkempt toilet. The eastern door leads to what once was a study.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin and Birdflu went westwards, exploring the hall and what lies beyond the north and south doors of the hall. Flinch looked intently and Lif, who had a troubled expression and was just hovering in the middle of the landing. Raven remained inside the study, and <strong>heard some splashing water coming from the northern wall</strong>. Birdflu on the other hand, went on exploring the north bedroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly, flinch noticed that Lif had a contorted expression and was getting pulled towards the northeastern wall! Meanwhile, approached the eastern door of the bedroom and opened it. Before him was a bathroom. The bathtub in it had water splashing inside, and a figure slowly materializing in front of him. Birdflu let out a shout to alert the others of what he saw.&nbsp;</p>
