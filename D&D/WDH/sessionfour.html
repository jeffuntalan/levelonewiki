<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The spectral apparition of the Trollskull Manor's former owner, Lif, appeared before the Ultrævils. It seems that despite Volo's failure to spot any ghosts in the manor, it was indeed, haunted. Lif explained that it was someone named Morgana, another former owner of the Trollskull Manor. Lif vanished after their conversation, and the Ultrævils decided to explore the upper floors that night.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The stairs leading to the estate is outside facing the north. When the Ultrævils entered the second floor, the winter wind was just as cold as it was outside, due to the windows that needed repairing. There were light sources, however, though they are scattered.&nbsp;</p>
