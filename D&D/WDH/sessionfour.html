<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The spectral apparition of the Trollskull Manor's former owner, Lif, appeared before the Ultrævils. It seems that despite Volo's failure to spot any ghosts in the manor, it was indeed, haunted. Lif explained that it was someone named Morgana, another former owner of the Trollskull Manor. Lif vanished after their conversation, and the Ultrævils decided to explore the upper floors that night.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The stairs leading to the estate is outside facing the north. When the Ultrævils entered the second floor, the winter wind was just as cold as it was outside, due to the windows that needed repairing. This first room was once the common room of the estate. There were light sources left behind by Volo but they are scattered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flinch decided to check the southern door while the others observed the former estate. There where smiling pictures of the former owner, holding a tankard of ale with some patrons. Some of these pictures hung on the wall, others lie on the floor. The silence of the derelict common room was broken only by the creaking of the southern door that Flinch opened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wave of cold air swept across their faces as the doors revealed a dark hall. Flinch took out his pen from his chest pocket and cast <i>Light</i> on it. The western staircase was illuminated, showing a passage to the third floor. However, <strong>three spectrelings</strong> in the form of children were disturbed by the light! Flinch tried to close the door on them, but the spectrelings traversed through the walls and fought them. Birdflu tried to coax them into nonhostility with an illusion of a ball, but they wen at the Ultrævils nevertheless. Putting out the pen light did nothing to calm them as well. In the end, the spectrelings were defeated; their childlike visage reduced to ectoplasmic goop. The Ultrævils scouted the rest of the floor, finding only rubble, spare bedrooms, and a dilapidated den. The proceeded to the third floor.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the top of the stairs, the Ultrævils&nbsp;notice Lif floating idly in the middle of the third floor landing. There is a staircase here leading to the fourth floor, a hallway to the west, and two doors to the east of the staircase where they were. Flinch opened the northern door under the staircase cautiously, only to find an unkempt toilet. The eastern door leads to what once was a study.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin and Birdflu went westwards, exploring the hall and what lies beyond the north and south doors of the hall. Flinch looked intently and Lif, who had a troubled expression and was just hovering in the middle of the landing. Raven remained inside the study, and <strong>heard some splashing water coming from the northern wall</strong>. Birdflu on the other hand, went on exploring the north bedroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly, flinch noticed that Lif had a contorted expression and was getting pulled towards the northeastern wall! Meanwhile, approached the eastern door of the bedroom and opened it. Before him was a bathroom. The bathtub in it had water splashing inside, and a figure slowly materializing in front of him. Birdflu let out a shout to alert the others of what he saw.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Flinch heard the shout, he ran to where Birdflu is. Robin did so too, while Raven was just about to leave the study. Raven saw Lif getting sucked into the northeastern wall of the landing as she ran to where the others went.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flinch immediately darted for the door where Birdflu saw the apparition, and before them, a humanoid figure has finished materializing. The creature a spectral quality to it, but also had the appearance of a horrific hag in the flesh. The Ultrævils immediately started attacking. Robin shot arrows, but they were not dealing the expected damage one would wish. Flinch had better luck with his <strong>Yklwa. </strong>Raven cast her shillelagh and used her enchanted quarterstaff to fight. Birdflu repeatedly threw insults at it. In the thick of battle, the hag (now identified as <strong>Morgana</strong>) controlled Lif to be hostile towards the Ultrævils. The family noticed that Lif had an ethereal arcane crown on his head as he attacked. Birdflue and Raven eventually jumped into the bathtub with Morgana, fearing she might use Lif as a barrier between them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without fighting Lif, the Ultrævils‘ attacks drew their toll on the hag husk. The final blow came in the spell <i>Dissonant Whispers,</i> which sent Morgana in throes of pain as she wondered if <i>maybe, they’re gonna be the one to save her</i>. But they didn’t, and she was defeated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lif snapped out of his mindless hostility, a spell now lifted. He began to take a much clearer form, that which resembles the paintings hanging on the old walls of the Trollskull manor—a smiling half-elf barkeep. The Ultrævils brushed themselves off, and wanted to talk to Lif about their planned emloyment of him. In response, Lif just started to sweep the floor, and tidy the room. Lif looks satisfied at the turn of events.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the Ultrævils explored the rest of the now peaceful manor, dibs were being called for the sleeping arrangements. Shrike was still at the ground floor keeping watch, but was called upstairs for a night of rest in their new home.</p>
<h2><strong>Unlikely Visitors</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next day, the new of the Ultrævils‘ feat of rescuing not only Floon, but also Renear were reaching the ears of the city folk. On top of that, they were now the proud owners of the largest house on Trollskull Alley. At around 8AM that morning, the Ultrævils heard a knock at the door of the tavern. Birdflu answered the door, and on the other side were two humans, one of them dressed in fine clothing while the other in tattered formal wear. The finely dressed individual introduced himself as <strong>Emmek Frewn</strong>, owner of the pub across the street. He had a snooty demeanor to him, and he went to the Trollskull Manor to propose a business arrangement so their establishments would not ”step on each other’s toes”. Flinch invited him in, and Emmek entered. He threw side comments at the state of the manor, and even offered to buy it from them for 800 gold pieces. The Ultrævils declined, and Birdflu expressed his distaste for Emmek quite audibly. He might even have mentioned killing Emmek to Robin while Emmek was within earshot. Emmek immediately bid goodbye and tried to scamper out, but Birdflue, Robin, and Raven blocked the main exit. Emmek panicked and ran out the kitchen door.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, the other fellow still waited by the front entrance and Birdflu let him in. He introduced himself as <strong>Crent</strong>, a contractor. He looked young, and he dressed in professional clothing albeit a bit tattered. However, he stammers a lot when he speaks, and he did as he offered his services to the Ultrævils in exchange for a few silvers. When asked about himself, he told them that he is actively hiding from someone named <strong>Manshoon</strong> whom he has angered in the past and probably wanted him dead. This lead to him staying away from large offices where he might be identified, eventually driving him to look for odd jobs across Waterdeep. His main specialty however, was being a contractor to establishments as well a serving as a medium to the guilds of Waterdeep. Flinch saw the value of Crent in Trollskull Manor, and Birdflu wanted to make him stay. The family agreed to treat Crent as family, letting him stay in the manor for as long as he needs. Crent was evidently enthused to hear this, and immediately started off by taking Flinch and the others to survey the probable expenses that they will incur to bring the manor back to working order. In Crent’s estimate, it would take around <strong>1000 gold pieces and 12 days </strong>to restore Trollskull manor, as well as around <strong>250 gold in guild fees</strong> to source a good supply chain for liquor, food, and other expenses should they want to restore the Trollskull’s Tavern. The &nbsp;Ultrævils have yet do decide what they want to do with the first floor. That concludes the Ultrævils‘ first morning at their new peaceful home.</p>
<h2>The Factions of Waterdeep</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just as the Ultrævils were prepping for lunch, Flinch heard a voice in his head.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I am Vajra Safahr, the Blackstaff. Come to Blackstaff Tower in the Castle Ward at once. Bring your friends."&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></i>It was the leader of the Force grey calling for them herself. The Ultrævils have yet to decide when a light tapping can be heard from the door. A paper bird was repeatedly bumping onto the the wooden surface. Birdflu took this paper bird and read it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<i><strong>"Renaer tells us you are a good bet. He bought you tickets to the opera tonight at the Lightsinger Theater in the Sea Ward. If you are interested, meet Mirt at intermission. Private Box C. Formal attire is required for admittance."&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></i>Birdflu was excited by this invitation. He insists that they had to go. Not a few moments later a white cat had entered the premises. Raven started stroking the cat, which spoke. Speaking animals was already an uncommon sight, but this one beared a message:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<i><strong>"Interested in joining the Emerald Enclave? Come meet us at Phaulkonmere in the Southern Ward."</strong></i></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The white cat purred contentedly after this and jumped away to the nearest door. It seemed that the city of Waterdeep was coming to the Ultrævils&nbsp;instead of the other way around. Overwhelmed by the choices of invitations, the Ultrævils&nbsp;have yet to decide what to do.</p>
