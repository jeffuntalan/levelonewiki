<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The spectral apparition of the Trollskull Manor's former owner, Lif, appeared before the Ultrævils. It seems that despite Volo's failure to spot any ghosts in the manor, it was indeed, haunted. Lif explained that it was someone named Morgana, another former owner of the Trollskull Manor. Lif vanished after their conversation, and the Ultrævils decided to explore the upper floors that night.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The stairs leading to the estate is outside facing the north. When the Ultrævils entered the second floor, the winter wind was just as cold as it was outside, due to the windows that needed repairing. This first room was once the common room of the estate. There were light sources left behind by Volo but they are scattered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flinch decided to check the southern door while the others observed the former estate. There where smiling pictures of the former owner, holding a tankard of ale with some patrons. Some of these pictures hung on the wall, others lie on the floor. The silence of the derelict common room was broken only by the creaking of the southern door that Flinch opened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wave of cold air swept across their faces as the doors revealed</p>
