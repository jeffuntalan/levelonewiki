<h2>Opening Day Preparation</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Istrid's death brought about the challenge of hiding the body from prying eyes—quite difficult to do in the middle of a city, on the opening day of Nottelere. The family eventually came up with hiding the body underneath Birdflu's bed and concealing it with Raven's <i>Druidcraft</i>. Vines and flowers covered the body, and was an okay fix for the time being. After the body has been dealt with, members of the family took turns consoling Robin, who locked himself in his room. Robin didn't go out, so the family went downstairs to prepare for the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One by one, Crent went through the morning inventory, Ott prepped the meals, while the others cleaned and set the tables. A blizzard was still raging at the time but the family had already managed to alert notable people about the opening day. By afternoon that day, the first few customers had arrived.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Open for Business!</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One by one, friends, factionmates, neighbors, and even some nobles made their appearance. Volo, Floon, and Renaer were present, so did the Cassalanters, the dungsweepers, and even members of the Watch. All seemed well as the people ate, drank, and sang their course through the blizzard.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eventually night fell on the opening day. Robin was still upstairs at this time, occasionally peering down from the windows to glance at arriving guests when he noticed some scuffling at the 3rd floor of the manor.&nbsp;</p>
