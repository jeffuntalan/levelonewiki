<h2>Opening Day Preparation</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Istrid's death brought about the challenge of hiding the body from prying eyes—quite difficult to do in the middle of a city, on the opening day of Nottelere. The family eventually came up with hiding the body underneath Birdflu's bed and concealing it with Raven's <i>Druidcraft</i>. Vines and flowers covered the body, and was an okay fix for the time being. After the body has been dealt with, members of the family took turns consoling Robin, who locked himself in his room. Robin didn't go out, so the family went downstairs to prepare for the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One by one, Crent went through the morning inventory, Ott prepped the meals, while the others cleaned and set the tables. A blizzard was still raging at the time</p>
