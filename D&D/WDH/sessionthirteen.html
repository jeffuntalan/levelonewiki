<h2>Opening Day Preparation</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Istrid's death brought about the challenge of hiding the body from prying eyes—quite difficult to do in the middle of a city, on the opening day of Nottelere. The family eventually came up with hiding the body underneath Birdflu's bed and concealing it with Raven's <i>Druidcraft</i>. Vines and flowers covered the body, and was an okay fix for the time being. After the body has been dealt with, members of the family took turns consoling Robin, who locked himself in his room. Robin didn't go out, so the family went downstairs to prepare for the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One by one, Crent went through the morning inventory, Ott prepped the meals, while the others cleaned and set the tables. A blizzard was still raging at the time but the family had already managed to alert notable people about the opening day. By afternoon that day, the first few customers had arrived.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Open for Business!</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One by one, friends, factionmates, neighbors, and even some nobles made their appearance. Volo, Floon, and Renaer were present, so did the Cassalanters, the dungsweepers, and even members of the Watch. All seemed well as the people ate, drank, and sang their course through the blizzard. Some guests left early, like the Cassalanters, while a steady stream of guests came in to have their fill.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eventually night fell on the opening day. Robin was still upstairs at this time, occasionally peering down from the windows to glance at arriving guests when he noticed some scuffling at the 3rd floor of the manor. He went to investigate.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Birdflu messages Robin every now and then to check on him, and around 9PM, Robin had told Birdflu what he noticed. Upon hearing this, Birdflu, Igor, Aric, and Orpheus immediately went upstairs to check. After a few minutes of searching the third floor, they found no trace of what Robin told them about. It was not until Orpheus checked under Flinch's bed did the find out what it was. As Orpheus peered underneath the bed, a Barbed Devil stood up and flipped the bed, triggering a combat encounter.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While Aric and the others battled the Barbed Devil, Flinch and Raven were left downstairs. Raven noticed a hooded figure peering in from outside. Flinch went out to investigate, and as he did, he felt a compassionate feeling bubbling up towards the hooded figure. He managed to resist this, and he went in to tackle the hooded figure. The Veterans from Force Gray went with him and eventually, they managed to grapple the hooded figure. The mystery man was none other than Victoro Cassalanter, and just a few moments, his wife Ammalia came out of hiding after seeing his husband being taken captive. Both went with them willingly, upstairs to talk. Zardoz Zord came up beside Raven and tipped his hat, revealing himself and commented on the capture of Victoro: “<i>I've been following that one for quite a while now. Jarlaxle Baenre, at your service.”</i> Jarlaxle put his hat back on and asked to go with them. Flinch and Raven agreed reluctantly.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Birdflu and the other managed to defeat the Barbed Devil, and met with the others to find that the Cassalanters were captured by Flinch and the Veterans. Zardoz Zord came up with them to the second floor of the Tavern, while Crent and the others were left to manage the few remaining people for now.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upstairs, as the Cassalanters stood calmly bound but kept away from each other, Jarlaxle introduced himself. He claims to have been following the Cassalanters for some time now, for hints about the Stone of Golorr. He wants the stone to find Neverember's hidden cache of money in order to return it to the city of Waterdeep. This didn't sit well with the family's hopes for the money, as they intended to keep it for themselves should they find it. On the other hand, the Cassalanters were questioned about their motives.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Victoro Cassalanter knew that the stone would arrive at the hands of the family, and he intended to coerce them into giving the stone to him, through non-violent means. He and Ammalia both explained that they need the stone to appease Asmodeus, and save the souls if their twin daughters. Victoro added that part of the deal was to offer close to a million gold pieces to the deity, and they are currently still short of the amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the people below sang and drank, the family is still going through a few words with their rivals.</p>
