<h2>Turmoil at the Villa</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bodies lay scattered at the floor of the Gralhund Villa's dining area. The two thugs that blocked passage to stairs to the 2nd floor lie lifeless on the floor. Just before the made their way upstairs, Birdflu sent a paper bird to Flinch indicating their whereabouts and what transpired so far. The Ultrævils made their way up the stairs and into the second floor landing, where they encountered fighting between well armored guards of the Gralhund Villa, and the dark-cloaked Zhentarim agents they used to work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The guards seem to be concentrated on the eastern side of the landing, where a door is located. The guards are keeping the Zhents away from this door. On the other hand, a lone figure cloaked in black can be seen at the far south of the landing, pounding and kicking at the southern door. This man is shouting through the door, with a flying snake tattoo visible on his nape. half of his body is badly burnt.The Ultrævils identify this man as one of victims of the explosion back at Trollskull alley, the same man who took the Stone of Golor from Dalakhar's charred corpse. Birdflu recognizes this man as well. This was the very same man who attempted to kill him last night.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without wasting any time, raven fires a <i>Moonbeam</i> at the burnt man. Shrike and Renaer dash through the commotion and fought melee against the burnt man. The clash between the man and the Ultrævils did not last long. Arrows from Robin, along with Shrike's punches, Renaer's rapier, and Raven's <i>Moonbeam</i> made short work of the already injured assassin. As Shrike knocked the assassin unconscious, Orpheus and Birdflu managed to take down a few of the Zhents attacking the guards. Before long, only the guards stand between them and the Eastern door. A whimpering can be heard at the Southern door, however.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The eastern door opened with the loss of the sounds of battle. Yalah Gralhund can be seen armored in the eastern room, along with Hrabbaz, their orcish bodyguard. Yalah is seen clutching a pistol, as a smile slowly curled across her face. Yalah and the Ultrævils exchanged pleasantries, and eventually, Birdflu asked about the attempt on his life, as well as the Stone of Golor. Yalah simply laughed at his questions, but eventually explained herself. Regarding the attempt on Birdflu's life, Yalah simply told them that she wanted Birdflu out of the equation for what he witnessed. On matter of the Stone of Golor however, is where it gets complicated. Yalah was after the stone, but she has an unwavering distrust for the Zhentarim, despite working with them because of her husband. Yalah tasked Urstul Floxin, the same person who attempted assassinating Birdflu to also intercept Dalakhar and obtain the Stone. Little did Urstul know that Yalah employed the service of a Nimblewright, who was equipped with a necklace of fireballs.The Nimblewright managed to find Dalakhar, sent a fireball his way, and managed to nearly kill Urstul in the process, on top of the eleven other people who were actually killed.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Great. Now we have someone to pin the crime to. Guards, capture them and call the City Watch, these trespassers killed some of our guests”, Yalah said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before the guards could act, Robin managed to grab a smoke bomb from his pack and throw it on the floor, providing some time for the Ultrævils to grab the unconscious Urstul, and escape. By the time the smoke cleared, the Ultrævils were already in their carriage, making their way back to Trollskull Alley. By this time, the wind has started howling, and the snow is falling at a heavy rate.</p>
<h2>A Winter's Chill</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the Dock Ward at about the same time as the bloodbath in the villa, Flinch sat on the sidewalk, keeping watch over the Dungsweepers. Slowly, a single snowflake rested on Flinch's leg. The wind started blowing, sending chills to the Dungsweepers. The head Dungsweeper, Crom, called the others to distribute cold weather clothes. A spare jacket was available, which he gave to Flinch. Flinch accepted this, and just as he put it on, a paper bird landed on an empty space in the pavement in front of him.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon opening the letter, Flinch was filled in on the details about the burnt man, the hunt for the Stone of Golor, and his family's plea for his help.Flinch felt the urgency of the message, and immediately cooked up a plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flinch talked to Crom, whom he is trying to convince to give the day off to the Dungsweepers. A blizzard was already brewing, which made it easy for Crom to accept Flinch's suggestion. Before long, Flinch was on his way to the Gralhund Villa.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right before Flinch could approach the Villa's block, he saw a familiar carriage coming his way. It was his family! The Ultrævils were travelling at a fast pace to the direction of Trollskull, to which Flinch followed.</p>
<h2>Captive</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once they arrive at the manor, the Ultrævils tie up Urstul Floxin at the basement. He was still unconscious, so Raven healed him to wake him up. Urstul awoke to find the Ultrævils around him, questioning him of his motives. He had an overconfident air to him, and would not say a thing about the location of the stone, or what happened at Gralhund Villa. Shrike and Birdflu threatened him that they would set the City Watch on him, to which simply replied that if he goes to the Watch, he will make sure that they go with him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At this point, the Ultrævils were already on the line for a visit from the City Watch anyway, as Yalah Gralhund called them up while they were still at the manor. It was only a matter of time until the Watch appear at their doorstep anyway. After a short discussion, the family decided that the best course of action would be to approach the City Watch as well and report the crime as they witnessed it. Birdflu and Shrike volunteered to talk to the Watch, and attempt to clear their names. Not a few minutes later, Birdflu and Shrike were already in their carriage to the Watch's Headquarters.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Back at the manor, Flinch, Raven, and Robin were having a hard time getting Urstul to talk. He kept his overconfidence even if he was held captive, and bound to a chair. Robin attempted to talk to him in Thieve's Cant, to which he replied. Despite this, he still would not spill any details. Flinch even offered him his freedom in exchange for information, a deal he considered.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was Raven who struck a nerve with him. After a short small talk of his achievements, Urstul was found to be susceptible to ridicule about his achivements and performance. He is a prideful individual, and getting beaten by Birdflu at an assassination attempt, getting caught in a fireball in an act of betrayal, and finally getting captured by none other than the Ultrævils (all in the same day too) were enough to tick him off. Urstul went on about Birdflu's stroke of luck during his attempt at Birdflu's life, and after a while we got into the topic of the Zhentarim.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Zhentarim has an internal strife at this time, and many Zhents expressed their allegiance to their leader instead of the Gralhunds, who funded most of their operations. The Gralhunds caught wind of this shift in allegiance and started to distrust them. Urstul said that he did manage to get the Stone of Golor from Dalakhar's body after surviving the explosion, and he did bring it back to Gralhund Villa to honor his end of the bargain. Unfortunately, Yalah had different plans. Urstul was immediately taken captive in the Villa, and Yalah took the stone by force, thinking that Urstul intends to keep it for himself. Her suspicion was justified, however, since Urstul planned to swap the Stone and give Yalah a dud. The true Stone, he planned to give to his true master---Manshoon.</p>
<h2>The Second Double-Cross</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the barrage of information that Urstul spilled, the family was left with only one question: where was the Stone now? Urstul reminded them of their offer, information in exchange for freedom. The Ultrævils agreed. Manshoon offered them a place in the Zhentarim, to work with him to kill Yalah and join their ranks. Although tempting, the players declined, but agreed to set him free once he confirms the location of the stone. Urstul told them that the Gralhund Nimblewright, an automaton named <strong>Nim</strong>, took the stone when the battle started and fled with it. Its location is currently unknown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right on cue, the door of the basement flew open. Birdflu and Shrike went in and overheard the deal of letting Urstul go in exchange for information. Birdflu agreed to let him go, knowing fully that the City Watch and Saeth Cromley were waiting upstairs. Urstul was set free and he shot at the door and into the Tavern area of Trollskull Manor where he was met by the officers and once again, captured.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This angered Urstul, and he began shouting that they should take Robin in as well, since he is a Zhent like him. The Ultrævils backed Robin up and defended him. Renaer even spoke up and defended them as well. Saeth was on the side of the Ultrævils, and just handed them the Court Hearing that they need to attend to. Yalah had filed a report against them, implicating them of the murders in the Villa, on top of trespassing. Some members of the City Watch cam knocking at the door of the manor to arrest the Ultrævils, not knowing of Saeth's arrangement of a Court Hearing for the alleged crime. After setting the story straight, the Ultrævils need to attend the Court Hearing in 4 days.</p>
<h2>A Web of Lies</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the Watch departed with Urstul, the Ultrævils were left with the realization that the opening of Trollskull is in 2 days. Their involvement with the Gralhund Bloodbath could be bad for business, and Birdflu had the idea of spreading rumors against Yalah to buffer their negative press. They invited over a few local gossips over at the manor to get started, talking about Yalah's infidelity, as well as her attempt at framing them. The tea was definitely served hot during that day.</p>
