<h2>Turmoil at the Villa</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bodies lay scattered at the floor of the Gralhund Villa's dining area. The two thugs that blocked passage to stairs to the 2nd floor lie lifeless on the floor. The Ultrævils made their way up the stairs and into the second floor landing, where they encountered fighting between well armored guards of the Gralhund Villa, and the dark-cloaked Zhentarim agents they used to work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The guards seem to be concentrated on the eastern side of the landing, where a door is located. The guards are keeping the Zhents away from this door. On the other hand, a lone figure cloaked in black can be seen at the far south of the landing, pounding and kicking at the southern door. This man is shouting through the door, with a flying snake tattoo visible on his nape. half of his body is badly burnt.The Ultrævils identify this man as one of victims of the explosion back at Trollskull alley, the same man who took the Stone of Golor from Dalakhar's charred corpse. Birdflu recognizes this man as well. This was the very same man who attempted to kill him last night.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without wasting any time, raven fires a <i>Moonbeam</i> at the burnt man. Shrike and Renaer dash through the commotion and fought melee against the burnt man.&nbsp;</p>
