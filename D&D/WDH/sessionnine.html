<h2>Turmoil at the Villa</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bodies lay scattered at the floor of the Gralhund Villa's dining area. The two thugs that blocked passage to stairs to the 2nd floor lie lifeless on the floor. The Ultrævils made their way up the stairs and into the second floor landing, where they encountered fighting between well armored guards of the Gralhund Villa, and the dark-cloaked Zhentarim agents they used to work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The guards seem to be concentrated on the eastern side of the landing, where a door is located. The guards are keeping the Zhents away from this door. On the other hand, a lone figure cloaked in black can be seen at the far south of the landing, pounding and kicking at the southern door. This man is shouting through the door, with a flying snake tattoo visible on his nape. half of his body is badly burnt.The Ultrævils identify this man as one of victims of the explosion back at Trollskull alley, the same man who took the Stone of Golor from Dalakhar's charred corpse. Birdflu recognizes this man as well. This was the very same man who attempted to kill him last night.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without wasting any time, raven fires a <i>Moonbeam</i> at the burnt man. Shrike and Renaer dash through the commotion and fought melee against the burnt man. The clash between the man and the Ultrævils did not last long. Arrows from Robin, along with Shrike's punches, Renaer's rapier, and Raven's <i>Moonbeam</i> made short work of the already injured assassin. As Shrike knocked the assassin unconscious, Orpheus and Birdflu managed to take down a few of the Zhents attacking the guards. Before long, only the guards stand between them and the Eastern door. A whimpering can be heard at the Southern door, however.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The eastern door opened with the loss of the sounds of battle. Yalah Gralhund can be seen armored in the eastern room, along with Hrabbaz, their orcish bodyguard. Yalah is seen clutching a pistol, as a smile slowly curled across her face.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Great. Now we have someone to pin the crime to. Guards, capture them and call the City Watch, these trespassers killed some of our guests”, Yalah said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before the guards could act, Robin managed to grab a smoke bomb from his pack and throw it on the floor, providing some time for the Ultrævils to grab the unconscious Urstul, and escape. By the time the smoke cleared, the Ultrævils were already in their carriage, making their way back to Trollskull Alley. By this time, the wind has started howling, and the snow is falling at a heavy rate.</p>
<h2>A Winter's Chill</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the Dock Ward at about the same time as the bloodbath in the villa, Flinch sat on the sidewalk, keeping watch over the Dungsweepers. Slowly, a single snowflake rested on Flinch's leg. The wind started blowing, sending chills to the Dungsweepers. The head Dungsweeper, Crom, called the others to distribute cold weather clothes. A spare jacket was available, which he gave to Flinch. Flinch accepted this, and just as he put it on, a paper bird landed on an empty space</p>
