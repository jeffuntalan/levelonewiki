<h2>Waterdeep</h2>
<p>Waterdeep is known as "The City of Splendors" or "The Crown of the North". It is the most influential city in the North, and perhaps, in all of Faerûn. It is a cosmopolitan city of great culture that attracted the most talented artisans, artists, and scholars from across the Realms, as well as a commercial hub for financial interests along the coast and beyond.</p>
<h2>The Government</h2>
<p>Waterdeep is governed by a 16-seat council known as the "Masked Lords". Their identities are kept secret, and they wear masks and long garbs (known as the "Lord's Ensemble") whenever they show themselves in public or whenever they meet. The leader of the masked lords is called the Open Lord.</p>

<h2>The City Watch</h2>
<p>Also known as "watchers" serves as the police force within the city of Waterdeep. Its strict code of conduct and well trained operatives made the Watch one of the most trusted police forces in Faerûn. They help uphold laws in Waterdeep, as listed in the <i>Code Legal.&nbsp;</i></p>

<h2>Breaking the Law</h2>
<p>Waterdeep is a city of firm laws and swift justice. Adventurers hell-bent on slaughter and plunder won't fare well in the City of Splendors. The punishments for assault, arson, theft, and murder are severe, regardless of the reason for the crime.</p>

<h2>Walking Statues of Waterdeep</h2>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:100%;"><img src="https://5e.tools/img/adventure/WDH/Walking-Statue.jpg"></figure>
<p>Scattered throughout Waterdeep are eight enormous statues that each bear a unique appearance.</p>
<p><i><strong>Landmarks</strong></i>. Over the years, Waterdavians have built structures around and on top of several of the statues.</p>
<h2>Seasons</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Spring</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In Waterdeep, early spring tends to be cold and damp. Misty rain falls for days on end. It's common for fog to settle at night and last through the day. As the weather improves, the city attracts more visitors, and the streets become increasingly crowded as summer approaches.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Summer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Summers in Waterdeep are quite comfortable, and it's a great time for citizens and visitors to congregate outside. The markets are busier than at any other time of year. Sometimes, though, warm air pushes up from the south and settles in the valleys north and east of the city. This air gets trapped, creating a hot spell that might last days or weeks. Activity in the city slows to a crawl, since Waterdavians are unaccustomed to such heat.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Autumn</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout autumn, wagonloads of food arrive in Waterdeep from outlying farms. Without this bounty, city folk would starve during the winter. Cold, howling sea winds remind Waterdavians that winter is near.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Winter</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Waterdavian winters are harsh. As snow piles up around the city and ice fills the harbor, trade grinds to a halt and the city seals its gates. Citizens willing to brave the cold still gather in local taverns and festhalls, but few venture outside the city walls.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Faerûnian Calendar</p>
  <p>The Faerûnian calendar has twelve months that roughly correspond to the months of the Gregorian calendar. Each month has thirty days divided into three ten-day weeks (each week is called a tenday). Scattered throughout the year are five holidays that aren't considered part of any month. Once every four years, the holiday of Shieldmeet is added to the calendar as a leap day immediately following Midsummer night. Collectively, these days create a cycle similar to what we have on Earth: three 365-day years followed by a leap year.</p>
  <p>Months.</p>
  <p>The Faerûnian months are Hammer, Alturiak, Ches, Tarsakh, Mirtul, Kythorn, Flamerule, Eleasis, Eleint, Marpenoth, Uktar, and Nightal.</p>
  <p>Annual Holidays.</p>
  <p>The annual holidays are Midwinter (between Hammer and Alturiak), Greengrass (between Tarsakh and Mirtul), Midsummer (between Flamerule and Eleasis), Highharvestide (between Eleint and Marpenoth), and the Feast of the Moon (between Uktar and Nightal).</p>
