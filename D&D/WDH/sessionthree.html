<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shrike and the Duergar managed to keep the door shut, while still being clueless of what lies on the other side. Their animosity was short lived, as the Duergar did not plug the bottom of the door, and a gray ooze seeped underneath. It immediately attacked the Duergar and Shrike, both of whom retaliated. The duergar's sword was corroded by the hits it inflicted on the ooze. They managed to defeat the ooze and they introduced themselves. The Ultrævils&nbsp;met Zemk, the Duergar, who thanked them for their help thought of them as new recruits to the guild.</p>
