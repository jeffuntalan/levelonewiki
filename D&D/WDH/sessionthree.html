<h2>The Xanathar's Guild Hideout</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shrike and the Duergar managed to keep the door shut, while still being clueless of what lies on the other side. Their animosity was short lived, as the Duergar did not plug the bottom of the door, and a gray ooze seeped underneath. It immediately attacked the Duergar and Shrike, both of whom retaliated. The duergar's sword was corroded by the hits it inflicted on the ooze. They managed to defeat the ooze and they introduced themselves. The Ultrævils&nbsp;met Zemk, the Duergar, who thanked them for their help and thought of them as new recruits to the guild. The Ultrævils&nbsp;went with it and managed to slip past him quoting that they “might be late". Flinch kept the paper bird within his grasp to prevent unwanted attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin was ahead of the family. He slipped passed the door while introductions where in place and found himself in a long corridor, at the end of which was a flight of stairs going up. As he went closer, he could hear the shrieks of pain from a humanoid, who, from the sound of it, is getting beaten up. The rest of the family and Renaer caught up with him, and after carefully peeking, they confirmed that the human getting beaten up was indeed Floon. Besides Floon, they can also see a thug with its back turned against them, the half-orc beating up Floon, and a tall purple figure with tentacles protruding from its lower face. This purple figure is holding what appears to be a brain with feet.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;started plotting what to do. Robin suggested that they throw in a smoke bomb, take Floon, and go. The family agreed and before long, the room was covered in smoke. Raven sent in Owlbert to distract the thug, and Shrike stormed in to retrieve Floon. As all of this was happening, they heard a soft plop of something being dropped to the ground. The purple figure floated out of their sight and into a room to the west of the hall. Flinch and the others ganged up on the thug and knocked him unconscious while Birdflu managed to cast <i>Sleep</i> on the half-orc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hall was closed off and no ventilation was present to help clear out the smoke. Raven noticed a set of stairs leading to the east and told his family of this path. She sent Owlbert to investigate. The others, however, already decided to retrace their steps and escape from where they came from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Birdflu, Shrike, and Flinch reached the room with Zemk and casually told him that the training session finished early. Zemk, however was a bit suspicious. Birdflu followed, and soon after, Floon came running across the room and into the nearest exit. This was enough to confirm Zemk;s suspicion. He raised his corroded weapon against the Ultrævils&nbsp;and tried to delay them. Meanwhile, Owlbert found the backside of a hidden door at the end of the eastern passage. It led to a tidy cellar of some sort. Raven was drawn to using this passage, but gave it up since her family was already taking the previous path. She ran into her family exchanging blows with Zemk, and she helped. Before long, Zemk was defeated.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;simply snuck back by the sleeping goblins, and went their way through the sewers, and decided to walk back the Yawning Portal with Floon in tow, their feet dripping with sewage.</p>
<h2>A Good Deed</h2>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:40.38%;"><img src="/images/wdh/volo.png">

</figure>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;managed to get Floon back to the Yawning Portal. It was nearly noon, and no customers were around save for Volo. Bonnie was also here, managing some taver-related stuff. Volo was overjoyed at the sight of Floon, who, despite the smell, was already in tip-top shape thanks to Raven's healing. The Ultrævils&nbsp;sat down and Flinch immediately went to Bonnie to try and sell off some of the loot they got. The Yawning Portal was running short on some swords and weapons and the Ultrævils&nbsp; managed to find some quality arms from the Zhentarim hideout. Bonnie bought them at full price.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Volo, on the other hand, was a bit tense as he started to tell the Ultrævils&nbsp;a confession. He only has 200 gold, despite promising 500 gold. He explained that book sales were not doing too well, and the incident with Floon sent him to desperation with finding someone to retrieve him. Volo offered instead a piece of property in the North Ward, called Trollskull Manor, to make up for the rest. Renaer on the other hand, added to this sum 150 gold from his own pocket as thanks for saving him. The Ultrævils&nbsp;went silent and Flinch was starting to look displeased. He eventually told Volo off about not keeping his promise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flinch grew suspicious of the deed they were given and inspected it. It looked official. He questioned why Volo was just giving it away, thinking there must be a catch. Volo explained that he got the property at an auction, where it was sold to him for a high price. It was, however, in bad condition. The manor was previously a tavern, and at some point it was an orphanage, a library, and even a home to an affluent family. Volo further explained that he was allured to the manor's past thinking that it could be a good investment for his planned book <i>Volo's Guide to Spirits and Specters</i>. This book has note yet been released, and Volo still hasn't seen any sign of a ghost or specter in the manor.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flinch grew very dissatisfied with Volo's response and he created a contract stating that Volo cannot take the manor back at any cost, nor profit from it in any way after it switches ownership to the Ultrævils. Volo signs this, and immediately takes his leave, bidding goodbye to Renaer and Floon. The Ultrævils&nbsp;take their time to bathe and collect themselves before heading over to Trollskull Alley, where their new manor is located.</p>
<h2>Trollskull Alley</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After paying for a carriage to the North Ward, the Ultrævils were greeted by the well kept streets, and the respectable-looking buildings of the alley. This is a stark difference to Trollskull Manor, which is looking run-down compared to the rest of the buildings here. The Ultrævils went inside, and the interior was not any better. Broken chairs and tables litter the floor, paintings hung loosely on the walls, if not entirely fallen and cracked. Dust is a common theme here, but amidst the traces of neglect, it was indeed previously a tavern--and a respectable one at that.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin immediately went ahead and cleaned what he could, and the rest of the family helped. They also explored the rest of the manor along with the top stories, which contained the living quarters. Flinch went outside and explored the neighboring buildings, meeting a few shop owners in the process. He also managed to get some Holy Water from a nearby church, as precaution for ghosts in the manor.</p>

  <figcaption>Areas of Trollskull Alley</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>T1. Trollskull Manor&nbsp;</strong><br>Four stories tall and boasting balconies, a turret, and five chimneys, the abandoned building is one of the grandest in Trollskull Alley.</p>
  <p><strong>T2. The Bent Nail</strong><br>A small wooden sign above this shop's main door is bare except for a large, bent nail sticking out of it. The front room contains displays of ornate wooden furniture, as well as a selection of bows and crossbows. The wall behind the counter is lined with rows of finely carved wooden canes, quarterstaffs, and shields.</p>
  <p><u>Talisolvanar "Tally" Fellbranch</u>, the owner and chief artisan of the Bent Nail, is a male half-elf carpenter and woodcarver.</p>
  <p><strong>T3. Steam and Steel</strong><br>During daylight hours, smoke and steam billow from the many windows around this indoor forge where metal weapons, armor, and tools are made. The forge is owned and operated by a married couple: a fire genasi named <u>Embric</u> and a water genasi named <u>Avi</u>.</p>
  <p><strong>T4. Corellon's Crown</strong><br><u>Fala Lefaliir</u>, an herbalist, operates out of this stately, three-story town house, the third floor of which has been converted into a greenhouse. Its translucent glass walls allow anyone on the street to see the rainbow of flowers blossoming within.</p>
  <p><strong>T5. Tiger's Eye</strong><br>This private detective's business is unremarkable on the outside, its only distinguishing mark an orange-and-black sign featuring a cat's eyes. Inside is a regal apartment dimly lit by flickering oil lamps. The door is locked, and visitors must knock or ring the bell before being let in.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The establishment is operated by <u>Vincent Trench</u>, a human detective and the owner of the Tiger's Eye. He dresses in a sharp suit, and smokes a slim pipe.</p>
  <p><strong>T6. Book Wyrm's Treasure</strong><br>The front of this bookstore is adorned with a charming sign of a gold dragon curled around a treasure hoard of books and scrolls. Inside, the shop is decorated with beautiful hardwood, and the earthy scent of old books permeates the air. The library fills two floors of this three-story building, and it somehow seems to contain more shelves than the building should be able to hold.</p>
  <p>The shop is managed by a short dragonborn of gold dragon ancestry named <u>Rishaal the Page-Turner</u>.</p>
  <p><strong>T7. Sewer Access</strong><br>It's here. If you ever want to return to this place.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Haunting of Trollskull Manor</h2>
<figure class="image image_resized image-style-align-left" style="width:31.71%;"><img src="/images/wdh/lif.png">
  <figcaption>The Ultrævils communicating with Lif through ash.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evening has fallen on the Ultrævils. Flinch has returned after meeting many of the alley's shopkeepers, and the rest are finishing up cleaning the lower floor. It has seen improvement since they first arrived, but Raven started to notice that some of the stuff they tidied were getting returned to where they initially were. After a while the furniture started moving and they were starting to notice it. Raven investigated near the fireplace, and a figure appeared before her.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The apparition was that of an elvish specter, who had a vacant expression. The specter wanted them out, but Ultrævils told him that they are the owners of the place now. The specter cannot speak, but was able to communicate by shoving some ash from the fireplace and onto the floor and writing down his answers. He introduced himself as Lif, the previous owner of the Trollskull Tavern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While this was happening, Robin and Birdflu plotted to sprinkle some holy water onto the specter, suspicious of its motives. Lif, however, told them that he cannot escape the place because of <strong>Morgana</strong>. Lif disappeared after a while.</p>
