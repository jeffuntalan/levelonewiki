<h2>The Xanathar's Guild Hideout</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shrike and the Duergar managed to keep the door shut, while still being clueless of what lies on the other side. Their animosity was short lived, as the Duergar did not plug the bottom of the door, and a gray ooze seeped underneath. It immediately attacked the Duergar and Shrike, both of whom retaliated. The duergar's sword was corroded by the hits it inflicted on the ooze. They managed to defeat the ooze and they introduced themselves. The Ultrævils&nbsp;met Zemk, the Duergar, who thanked them for their help and thought of them as new recruits to the guild. The Ultrævils&nbsp;went with it and managed to slip past him quoting that they “might be late". Flinch kept the paper bird within his grasp to prevent unwanted attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin was ahead of the family. He slipped passed the door while introductions where in place and found himself in a long corridor, at the end of which was a flight of stairs going up. As he went closer, he could hear the shrieks of pain from a humanoid, who, from the sound of it, is getting beaten up. The rest of the family and Renaer caught up with him, and after carefully peeking, they confirmed that the human getting beaten up was indeed Floon. Besides Floon, they can also see a thug with its back turned against them, the half-orc beating up Floon, and a tall purple figure with tentacles protruding from its lower face. This purple figure is holding what appears to be a brain with feet.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;started plotting what to do. Robin suggested that they throw in a smoke bomb, take Floon, and go. The family agreed and before long, the room was covered in smoke. Raven sent in Owlbert to distract the thug, and Shrike stormed in to retrieve Floon. As all of this was happening, they heard a soft plop of something being dropped to the ground. The purple figure floated out of their sight and into a room to the west of the hall. Flinch and the others ganged up on the thug and knocked him unconscious while Birdflu managed to cast <i>Sleep</i> on the half-orc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hall was closed off and no ventilation was present to help clear out the smoke. Raven noticed a set of stairs leading to the east and told his family of this path. She sent Owlbert to investigate. The others, however, already decided to retrace their steps and escape from where they came from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Birdflu, Shrike, and Flinch reached the room with Zemk and casually told him that the training session finished early. Zemk, however was a bit suspicious. Birdflu followed, and soon after, Floon came running across the room and into the nearest exit. This was enough to confirm Zemk;s suspicion. He raised his corroded weapon against the Ultrævils&nbsp;and tried to delay them. Meanwhile, Owlbert found the backside of a hidden door at the end of the eastern passage. It led to a tidy cellar of some sort. Raven was drawn to using this passage, but gave it up since her family was already taking the previous path. She ran into her family exchanging blows with Zemk, and she helped. Before long, Zemk was defeated.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;simply snuck back by the sleeping goblins, and went their way through the sewers, and decided to walk back the Yawning Portal with Floon in tow, their feet dripping with sewage.</p>
<h2>A Good Deed</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;managed to get Floon back to the Yawning Portal. It was nearly noon, and no customers were around save for Volo. Bonnie was also here, managing some taver-related stuff. Volo was overjoyed at the sight of Floon, who, despite the smell, was already in tip-top shape thanks to Raven's healing. The Ultrævils&nbsp;sat down and Flinch immediately went to Bonnie to try and sell off some of the loot they got. The Yawning Portal was running short on some swords and weapons and the Ultrævils&nbsp; managed to find some quality arms from the Zhentarim hideout. Bonnie bought them at full price.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Volo, on the other hand, was a bit tense as he started to tell the Ultrævils&nbsp;a confession. He only has 200 gold, despite promising 500 gold. He explained that book sales were not doing too well, and the incident with Floon sent him to desperation with finding someone to retrieve him. Volo offered instead a piece of property in the North Ward, called Trollskull Manor, to make up for the rest. Renaer on the other hand, added to this sum 150 gold from his own pocket as thanks for saving him. The Ultrævils&nbsp;went silent and Flinch was starting to look displeased. He eventually told Volo off about not keeping his promise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flinch grew suspicious of the deed they were given and inspected it. It looked official. He questioned why Volo was just giving it away, thinking there must be a catch. Volo explained that he got the property at an auction, where it was sold to him for a high price. It was, however, in bad condition. The manor was previously a tavern, and at some point it was an orphanage, a library, and even a home to an affluent family. Volo further explained that he was allured to the manor's past thinking that it could be a good investment for his planned book <i>Volo's Guide to Spirits and Specters</i>.&nbsp;</p>
