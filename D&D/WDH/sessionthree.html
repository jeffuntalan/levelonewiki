<h2>The Xanathar's Guild Hideout</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shrike and the Duergar managed to keep the door shut, while still being clueless of what lies on the other side. Their animosity was short lived, as the Duergar did not plug the bottom of the door, and a gray ooze seeped underneath. It immediately attacked the Duergar and Shrike, both of whom retaliated. The duergar's sword was corroded by the hits it inflicted on the ooze. They managed to defeat the ooze and they introduced themselves. The Ultrævils&nbsp;met Zemk, the Duergar, who thanked them for their help and thought of them as new recruits to the guild. The Ultrævils&nbsp;went with it and managed to slip past him quoting that they “might be late". Flinch kept the paper bird within his grasp to prevent unwanted attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Robin was ahead of the family. He slipped passed the door while introductions where in place and found himself in a long corridor, at the end of which was a flight of stairs going up. As he went closer, he could hear the shrieks of pain from a humanoid, who, from the sound of it, is getting beaten up. The rest of the family and Renaer caught up with him, and after carefully peeking, they confirmed that the human getting beaten up was indeed Floon. Besides Floon, they can also see a thug with its back turned against them, the half-orc beating up Floon, and a tall purple figure with tentacles protruding from its lower face. This purple figure is holding what appears to be a brain with feet.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;started plotting what to do. Robin suggested that they throw in a smoke bomb, take Floon, and go. The family agreed and before long, the room was covered in smoke. Raven sent in Owlbert to distract the thug, and Shrike stormed in to retrieve Floon. As all of this was happening, they heard a soft plop of something being dropped to the ground. The purple figure floated out of their sight and into a room to the west of the hall. Flinch and the others ganged up on the thug and knocked him unconscious while Birdflu managed to cast <i>Sleep</i> on the half-orc.&nbsp;</p>
