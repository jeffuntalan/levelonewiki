<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Birdflu starts the encounter attempting the diplomatic route and proceeds to raise his hands and try to talk to the Kenku here. However, he was poised to strike if they were hostile. And they were. There were six Kenku in the building who were apparently stayed be behind to try and loot the place. They exchanged strikes and arrows with the adventurers, who were injured Volo's healing potions proved to of help as Flinch (previously referenced as Peregrine) and Raven (previously referenced Dickcissel) took the brunt of the damage. Shrike started off unarmed, but was able to loot off the Kenku's shortswords and fight with them. Robin (previously referenced as Chase), ever the acrobatic one, stabbed and shot at the enemies as darted across the battlefield. In the end, the six Kenku were defeated and they were able to find someone who looked a lot like Floon.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trembling from the turn of events, and clothes soiled with rancid merchandise from the hideout, Ranaer Neverember was found hiding in a closet under the stairs. As he recalled, they were abducted by members of the Zhentarim back in the Skewered Dragon. As he and Floon were taken captive in the Zhentarim hideout, a bunch of Xanathar's Guild members ransacked the place and a lot were killed on both sides. Amidst the clash, Renaer managed to hide himself but Floon was not so lucky. Surviving <i>members of the Xanathar's Guild mistook Floon for Renaer </i>and as a result, Floon was taken by the Xanathar's Guild members while Renaer stayed behind. He wasn't able to escape immediately as some Kenku stayed behind. Unarmed and out of morale, he just hid.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It suddenly occurred to Flinch that <i>they were in a Zhentarim hideout</i>. He recalled a few weeks back that there were talks of a cache of silver trading bars being stolen by the Zhents in the Dock Ward. Zhents were rumored to hide their stuff in intricate safes hidden in their hideouts. From his experience as an intern for the Force Grey, he knew some examples of such a hiding place. A few inspections later, he found one such safe activated by a hidden button. Inside were four <i>Silverymoon, Neverwinter, Baldur's Gate, and Illuskan</i> painting sas well as the rumored <i>silver trading bars</i>--fifteen in total. Renaer, meanwhile, was readying himself to join the search for Floon by looking for a rapier.</p>
