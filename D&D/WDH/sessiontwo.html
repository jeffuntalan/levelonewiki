<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Birdflu starts the encounter attempting the diplomatic route and proceeds to raise his hands and try to talk to the Kenku here. However, he was poised to strike if they were hostile. And they were. There were six Kenku in the building who were apparently stayed be behind to try and loot the place. They exchanged strikes and arrows with the adventurers, who were injured Volo's healing potions proved to of help as Flinch (previously referenced as Peregrine) and Raven (previously referenced Dickcissel) took the brunt of the damage. Shrike started off unarmed, but was able to loot off the Kenku's shortswords and fight with them. Robin (previously referenced as Chase), ever the acrobatic one, stabbed and shot at the enemies as darted across the battlefield. In the end, the six Kenku were defeated and they were able to find someone who looked a lot like Floon.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trembling from the turn of events, and clothes soiled with rancid merchandise from the hideout, <strong>Ranaer Neverember</strong> was found hiding in a closet under the stairs. As he recalled, they were abducted by members of the Zhentarim back in the Skewered Dragon. As he and Floon were taken captive in the Zhentarim hideout, a bunch of Xanathar's Guild members ransacked the place and a lot were killed on both sides. Amidst the clash, Renaer managed to hide himself but Floon was not so lucky. Surviving <i>members of the Xanathar's Guild mistook Floon for Renaer </i>and as a result, Floon was taken by the Xanathar's Guild members while Renaer stayed behind. He wasn't able to escape immediately as some Kenku stayed behind. Unarmed and out of morale, he just hid. However, he heard that they were taking Floon <i><strong>somewhere in the sewers</strong></i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It suddenly occurred to Flinch that <i>they were in a Zhentarim hideout</i>. He recalled a few weeks back that there were talks of a cache of silver trading bars being stolen by the Zhents in the Dock Ward. Zhents were rumored to hide their stuff in intricate safes hidden in their hideouts. From his experience as an intern for the Force Grey, he knew some examples of such a hiding place. A few inspections later, he found one such safe activated by a hidden button. Inside were four <i>Silverymoon, Neverwinter, Baldur's Gate, and Illuskan</i> painting sas well as the rumored <i>silver trading bars</i>--fifteen in total. Shrike also managed to find something interesting in the upstairs offices: an unused <strong>paper bird</strong>. Renaer, meanwhile, was readying himself to join the search for Floon by looking for a rapier. Birflu eyes him suspiciously as he does so, holding his beloved rapier, <i>Caress</i> close.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was Raven who noticed the sudden thundering of footsteps outside the hideout as the Ultrævils scampered to stash the silver in their packs. Not a few moments later, more than a dozen City Watch arrived, fully geared and accompanied by no less than the City Watch captain himself, <strong>Hyustes Staget</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ultrævils&nbsp;were asked to freeze and stay where they were. They were asked about their involvement with the Zhents, but Renaer came forward immediately and explained the situation. The Ultrævils&nbsp;were told that criminal groups are active at this time and it would be best if they not get involved with any of them. When informed that a civilian, <i>Floon</i>, might be in danger, Hyustes simply replies that <i>whatever happens underneath the city is out of their jurisdiction</i> and <i>he will not risk the lives of any of his men in a search operation underneath the lawless network of sewers underneath Waterdeep</i>. Their job is to <i>keep the blood off the streets</i>, as he likes to say. The Ultrævils were not happy to hear this. Birdlfu, in particular was very vocal about his distaste for the captain of the City Watch. Sensing the kind of person Hyustes is, Flinch signals his family to go. The Ultrævils&nbsp;stepped out of the hideout, with loot in tow. Raven heard muffled talks as they leave, but they were too inaudible to make of.</p>
